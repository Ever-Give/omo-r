Hey, your stories are the best. Let me say that again.

I'm a male desperation fan and I love reading male and female here

U had a full bladder time writing those? For inspiration

U can tell me here or in private as md isn't the hot spot for most here maybe

Great great again

Oh and already looking forward to pt 2... I love Rex lol

More will be coming. Stay tuned üòÅ

I'm kind of a lurker and a bit shy to comment bc I dont wanna be annyoing but my feedback is: your stories are great! I'm a huge fan of how you describe desperation and even though I'm not really into women, your female stories are just so well written that I'm a fan anyways (nurses never need it for example; i love how competitive they get)

I hope I'm not going overboard with my praise, I just felt the need to say something uplifting

You have no idea how much your words have inspired me! Thank you for your kind words and the heartfelt application. And you are NOT annoying. So relax and enjoy. üòä

I'm a lurker as well and pretty shy myself but I love your stories. I'm one of those who love male desperation but don't see enough of it. So to see that you include both is awesome to me! I love your descpritions of the progess and honestly, I love the extremeness of it as well. Can't wait to read more. ^_^

Hi @Jasmine884

- thank you for taking out time and writing to me. Your words brought a smile on my face. And I may have a new story for you mixed with extreme male desperation:
