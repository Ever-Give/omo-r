Hey folks! It's been very long since I posted anything here. New job has eaten into all my free time. I am trying to write as and when I can. One of my patrons asked me to bring back Minx, who was my first OC into the Omo world and the princess of Extreme Desperation. In the below story we are going to push Minx, like never before. Enjoy!

###

It was barely dawn, and the early morning light filtered through the blinds into the room. Minx was already awake. Sort of. She laid on her back, sprawled on her bedsheets in a tight white leotard that was clearly undersized. The thin straps could barely hold back her overfilled saline boobs. She was sweating and slightly restless. She had one hand on her pillow, and the other was on her crotch, not grabbing, just there to give her occasional rub for morning arousal. Her thick brown hair was spread on her damp pillow.

A solid, bulge jutted from her lower belly. Her bladder was full like it had always been since she turned eighteen. For the past seven years she has followed a strict one-pee-a-day schedule, and she loved waking up to a full bladder. She blinked her big fake lashes open with a little groan, just five minutes before her alarm would’ve gone off.

Her eyes immediately fell on the whiteboard across the room, glowing faintly in the dim light. In messy pink marker, it screamed: “DO. NOT. PEE.”

She grinned. “Ohhh right,” she mumbled in her morning-husky voice, stretching like a pornstar in a car ad. She sat up slowly. A slight groan escaped her mouth as her swollen bladder reminded her of its presence. Her hand instinctively moved to her belly, giving it a tight squeeze. The pressure behind her pee hole spiked immediately, making her arch forward. “HOT!” she giggled. Above the whiteboard, a whole row of photographs was pinned to the wall. All of them were of her, in tiny outfits and massive bladder bulges. Each one after crushing others in holding competitions. Be it at college, her friends or other models like her. Minx stood up, feeling her leotard wedged way up her butt, pushing her butt plug further inside. Her bladder throbbed hard, protesting the movement. “Nope. No relief till I make BladderRox piss their pants today,” she whispered, half-laughing at herself as she waddled slightly on her way to the bathroom.

She peeled off her leotard with a grunt and hopped into the shower. As the spray hit her skin, she shivered and squealed from the desperate wave her bladder gave in protest. “No leaking yet,” she kept her legs apart, strictly. She tilted her head back under the stream, letting the water run down her curves, eyes half-lidded as she imagined the look on the nerdy inventor’s face when she didn’t burst. "This is gonna be sooo easy," she said to herself with a wink.

Once she stepped out, she had a message on her phone. “Good Morning, Ms. Minx. Please arrive full and wear something comfortable.”

“Comfortable, huh! My ass!” She pulled out her black leather shorts, tight and high waisted and coupled it with a beige leotard bodysuit. She was huffing and sweating by the time she finished dressing up. Her waist looked cinched, and everything was stretched tight on her body without any stretchability. Next was a pair of black 6-inch peep-toes. After a mirror selfie she left for BladderRox.

Minx stepped through the tall glass doors of the facility like she owned the place. Everyone around stopped in their tracks just to ogle at her, especially at the pronounced round bulge of her bladder. Her hands rested on her hips as she waved at the receptionist.

She nodded politely and gestured toward a sleek hallway. “Ms. Minx. Room 7. They're ready for you.”

“Oooh, mysterious,” Minx said, flipping her hair as she strutted ahead.

Room 7 looked more like a medical testing room meets police interrogation booth. Clean walls, a heavy-looking glass partition, and a single chair in the middle of the room. Next to it stood a woman. She was tall, stern, and in her mid-40s. Her graying hair was pulled into a perfect bun. Her suit was crisp and smooth. And just like Minx, it was too tight to hide her own bulging bladder. She held a slim silver case in one hand.

“Miss Minx,” the woman said curtly, “I’m Dr. Kinkly, lead of physical tolerance testing. You're late.”

Minx smirked and twirled a strand of hair around her finger. “Mmm, sorry, traffic was thick.” She gave her hip a little pop and let her bladder push forward just slightly more. “Hope I didn’t miss anything exciting.”

Dr. Kinkly did not smile. She simply opened the case with a quiet click, revealing a sleek, chrome-finish, device shaped like a vibrator. “This,” she said, lifting it carefully, “is the PressureSync V.5. You will insert it now and then dress yourself again.”

Minx’s eyes sparkled. “Wait, you want me to plug it up?” She snatched it and turned it over in her hand like she was inspecting a new toy. “Kinky. I love this company already.”

Dr. Kinkly raised an eyebrow. “It is not for arousal. It is for resistance. With each activation, your internal pressure will increase slightly. You will feel no volume increase, but the urge to urinate will grow exponentially.”

Minx was already stepping out of her shorts. “You know, you keep saying words like 'test' and 'pressure' and 'insert'. I’m going to end up edging myself and moaning, rather than getting desperate.” She unbuttoned her shorts which flung open like a spring. Then she peeled away her clingy beige bodysuit. Her body was glistening with sweat. She playfully wiggled her ass and pushed the device inside her vagina. It fit snugly. “Mmm. Oh yeah, it’s definitely in.”

“Please dress again.” Dr. Kinkly did not blink and left the room.

With a grunt and a hop, Minx slid her shorts back up, tucking her swollen midsection tight behind the skin-tight leather. Her bodysuit stretched even tighter than before. She pulled her hair into a loose ponytail and blew a kiss at the one-way mirror.

“Cute little start-up vibe you’ve got here,” she said, striking a proud pose. “So, what’s the plan? You press the button, and I win?”

Dr. Kinkly approached with a clipboard and without looking up, asked dryly, “Longest recorded hold and maximum volume?”

“Jeez! Do your homework,” Minx replied without hesitation. “I have gone entire weekends without flinching. And this will be the longest one...”

“Hmm,” Kinkly made a note. She looked up and gave the faintest, cold smile. “Then let’s see if you can survive even an hour here.”

Minx scoffed, “Oh, I like you.”

Kinkly waved to her scientists, unseen to Minx. One of them held a small remote with a single red button. “Whenever you’re ready,” Dr. Kinkly said without turning back.

Minx crossed her arms beneath her heavy chest and gave her swollen bladder a cocky pat. “Oh honey! I was born ready. I’ll hold it longer than you could even imagine.” She leaned back against the cold metal chair and parted her legs, “Go ahead. Click me.”

She caught a glimpse of herself in the glass partition across the room and gave herself a little wink. Then it happened. Click. Level 1.

The device inside her buzzed. It was a sharp pulse, not painful, but intense. Like her bladder was suddenly squeezed tightly while it clenched from the inside. Her legs jolted together, thighs gluing shut on reflex. Her eyes widened for a split second as her body shuddered.

What the hell?! she thought. Okay, that was... not fake. That was real.

She quickly recomposed, parting her legs again, rolling her neck like nothing had happened.

Behind the glass, Dr. Kinkly scribbled something down, eyes still fixed on her monitor.

“Well, Miss Minx,” her voice came through the intercom, smooth and clinical, “how did that first taste feel?”

Minx chuckled, flipping her ponytail over one shoulder. “Taste? Honey, that was like a weak fart. Barely noticed it.” But she wasn’t fooling anyone, at least of all herself.

Dr. Kinkly’s lips twitched into the faintest smirk.

“Your vitals suggest otherwise. A minor spike in heart rate. Slight muscle contraction. Increased breathing. Should we stop here, or continue?”

Minx snorted. “Stop? Babe, I’ve carried three gallons of wine to a party without peeing. I can handle a little buzz in the babymaker.”

“Very well.”

Click. Level 2.

This time, the jolt was sharper. It pulsated outward from deep in her bladder. Like big blob of water moving through a hose. Her entire tensed even tighter. Her jaw clenched, and her calves tensed. The bulge in her abdomen seemed to heat up, beneath her skintight bodysuit. Minx sat up straighter, gripping the armrests. Her teeth bit into her bottom lip, and she let out a slow hiss through her nose. She definitely felt that.

Okay… pressure’s going up faster than I thought, she admitted to herself, but whatever. I can take it. This is nothing. It's just mental. She shifted in her seat, crossing and uncrossing her legs casually, trying to shake off the wave of growing urgency. Her shorts had zero give, and now the seam was digging right into the most inconvenient spot. The pressure wasn’t just in her bladder — it was making her feel flustered and weirdly hot.

Dr. Kinkly tapped a few buttons, her eyes never leaving the screen.

“You’re breathing heavier. Do you require a break?”

Minx leaned forward, tossing her hair and smirking at the glass like she could see through it. “Breaks are for people with weak bladders. You better have a Level 200 in there, doc.”

Behind the glass, one of the scientists chuckled nervously. Kinkly didn’t. She just raised the remote and tapped the button every few minutes.

Click. Level 3.

Click. Level 4.

Click. Level 5.

Each one pressed her bladder a little harder from the inside, but Minx’s breathing settled back into a calm rhythm. The stress lines around her eyes smoothed out. She rolled her neck and flexed her toes lazily in her heels.

On the monitor, Minx’s heart rate and blood pressure drifted back toward baseline. Kinkly frowned. “Strange.” She turned to a lab assistant. “Pressure increase is linear. Subject’s vitals are adapting.”

“Maybe she’s… comfortable?” the assistant offered weakly.

“Not possible,” Kinkly said flatly. Even she couldn’t ignore what the numbers were showing.

Behind the glass, the observers kept expecting Minx to start fidgeting, bouncing her legs, biting her lip but the hours dragged on without anything happening. Minx she sat there like she was waiting for a manicure, casually scrolling her phone.

By midday, the pressure had crept into the double digits. Minx felt it, sure. Her bodysuit was slightly damp with sweat and her muscles were starting to ache. She could feel her bladder getting heavier, rounder, denser. But on her face, she kept it calm, giggling and binge watching on her phone. She had weekends that felt just like this. No pee breaks. All-day photo shoots, sex marathons and parties. Long car-rides and what not. Long car rides while sipping energy drinks. Friday to Sunday, without even looking at the bathroom door. So, she settled into her usual strategy: breathe slow, keep posture perfect, don’t think about the exit. Every once in a while, she’d cross her legs and tilt her hips forward just for fun and poke her bladder hard to shoot the pressure up for a few seconds before relaxing again.

By late afternoon, the light in the room had shifted to a warm orange. The levels climbed steadily.

Level 52. Level 68. Level 84.

Her shorts were digging into her bladder and squeezing her midsection. The leather trapped heat, and the waistband bit into the apex of her bladder. Minx sat on her heels now and gulped down. Kinkly kept glancing between the vitals and Minx herself. The woman in the chair still sat tall, smirking occasionally toward the pane, but the subtle changes were there if you knew where to look. The longer blinks. The barely noticeable clenching of her thighs after each click. The sweat shining on Minx’s cleavage.

By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, the counter on Kinkly’s console ticked over to: LEVEL 100

Kinkly leaned forward on the mic. “Miss Minx,” she said, her voice even but tinged with something like respect, “you have reached Level 100. Few subjects last to Level 40 without visible signs of strain. I am… impressed.”

Minx arched one brow and tilted her head toward the pane, lips curling in a half-smile. “Aww, thanks, doc. Means a lot coming from you. But if we’re done here, I’d love to go home, kick off my heels, drink some more and continue to hold.”

“Oh, Miss Minx. I think there’s been a misunderstanding.” She straightened, her voice carrying clearly through the speaker. “The program cannot be stopped. Not manually. It ends only when one of two events occur.”

Minx blinked, her smile dimming just slightly. “…Go on.”

“One: you lose control.”

Minx snorted softly. “Cute. Not happening.”

Kinkly’s gaze was unblinking. “Two: the titanium device itself gets damaged, from the inside, by the sheer force of your muscle contractions.”

Minx was shocked. Even though the idea of outlasting the machine was addictive, her muscles could not bend titanium. She bit her lips nervously looking at the clock. It read 9PM. She had been holding for well over 39 hours now. Not a big deal for her in normal circumstances except today.

“Then I guess,” she said, her voice low and cocky despite the maddening pressure behind her pee hole, “I’ll just have to crush your little toy.”

Kinkly’s fingers tapped the clicker one last time. “Auto mode engaged,” she said as if she were setting a coffee machine to brew. “Every three minutes, a level up. No manual override until I return.”

Minx blinked, smirking. “What, going to leave me unsupervised? How naughty of you, Kinkly.”

The woman gave no reaction “We’ll see how you’re feeling in the morning. In case you need to call the janitor press the call button on the wall behind you. You may use the bed kept in the corner.”

And then she was gone. The click of the laboratory door echoing down the now-hollow corridors of BladderRox HQ.

Three minutes later. Beep. Level 101.

Minx felt buzz again. It felt stronger like a slow hand squeezing from the inside. She crossed one leg over the other. This time it was with purpose – to squeeze her muscles tight. “Mm… cheeky little machine,” she whispered to herself, brushing imaginary lint from her short.

Another three minutes. Beep. Level 102. Her fingers twitched at her sides. She shifted her weight from one heel to the other. Alone in the white-bright lab, the faint whir of the device against her skin was almost teasing her ears. The desk in front of her suddenly felt like a very good thing to lean against.

“This is fine,” she told the room, out loud. “I’ve done way worse on weekends.”

Level 110.

Thirty minutes later.

The “fine” part was starting to feel a little… stretched. She’d begun pacing between the wall and the desk, just to keep her muscles from locking into one position. The device wasn’t giving her a break. Each level stacked onto the last like weights hung on a chain. Even breathing seemed to worsen the pressure.

“Still nothing I can’t handle,” she muttered. Though she had just pressed the heel of her hand against her thigh for no reason.

Level 160. Two hours later.

She had stopped pacing. Pacing made things bounce. Bouncing made things worse. Instead, she leaned over a tall stool, elbows planted, letting her knees bend just enough to keep them touching. Occasionally she let out a long, slow exhale that sounded like someone cooling down a pot of boiling water.

“This is definitely still within… bearable range,” she told herself. But she didn’t sound as cocky as before. Her toes curled inside her heels.

Level 200. Four and a half hours in.

The pressure was getting ‘unbearable’. She felt like a balloon filling at an open hose. She was biting her lips without realizing it. Her shorts had ridden higher and shuffled between her butt crack, from all her shifting. It pricked her butt and shoved her butt plug further up. However, fixing it meant uncrossing her legs. She wasn’t quite ready to do that.

The empty lab seemed too quiet, and with nothing to distract her, all her focus was on the throbbing sensation right behind her pee hole. Her knuckles were tight, and her nails dug into her thighs. Her jaws were clenched so tight, her teeth hurt.

Level 240. Nearly dawn.

Minx was leaning against the wall now. Sweat and hair clung to her face. Her back arched, her hand stretched up for support. Her sweaty legs were intertwined tight, and she was up on her toes. She was breathing with a hiss, the kind where she could still speak but probably shouldn’t try. She’d been counting the beeps at this point, not because she needed to… but because she couldn’t not.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, she was amazed at herself. She’d been in “normal weekend hold” mode hours ago but this… this was getting difficult even by her standards. Kinkly sure was pushing her.

Beep. Level 250.

The morning light slid through the lab’s high windows. Kinkly’s heels clicked on the tile, her eyes immediately going to the readout.

“Well,” she said simply, setting her bag down. “You’re still holding, somehow…”

Minx straightened hastily and removed her hand from her thighs. A sharp spasm shot through her nether to her core, making her double over. Sweat dripped from her face. “Yes. Just stretching by body!” She managed to speak and slowly stood up.

Kinkly’s smirked, “How do you feel?”

Minx took her chair, “I feel like I’m at school, holding my pee for fun.” The strain in her voice said otherwise though.

Kinkly watched Minx like a hawk. “Sooooo,” she said, dragging out the word, “do you really think you can still hold comfortably? Since this has all been…” she glanced at the vitals on her screen, “so easy so far.”

Minx spread her legs apart as if to prove her determination. Her face turned red with strain. A sharp spasm surged through her bladder. She blew air through her mouth to supress. Her face scrunched up, but she somehow supressed it. She looked down. She could see her bulge protruding upwards of her navel and the waistband was cutting into her skin. There was no comfortable position left for her to sit. She gave a confident little smirk, twirling a strand of her hair like she wasn’t holding back an Olympic swimming pool.

“I could do this all week. You wanna make it harder? Go ahead. I’m practically bored.”

“I really need to clench. Can’t let this bitch win!” She spoke to herself in her mind, “This thing inside me feels like a I’m holding back a broken dam!”

Kinkly’s lips curled into something between amusement and menace. “Perfect. Then instead of increasing levels in regular steps…” She tapped a few keys. “…we’ll take bigger intervals. Bigger jumps. No gentle ramp-up this time, Minx.”

Minx’s bladder throbbed. Her overfilled bladder was pressing her tired, cramped sphincters like a hydraulic press. “Bigger jumps?” she repeated, pretending to yawn. “What’s next, you gonna make it sing to me too?”

Minx’s stomach churned. She nervously gulped down as she braced for the next wave. “Bigger jumps?” she asked not to sound too stressed. Kinkly didn’t answer verbally. Instead, she pressed the clicker.

The device inside Minx throbbed furiously. Her eyes nearly popped out. The vein on her forehead bulged. “FUUUUCCCCKKKK!” She whisper-yelled to herself. “This….is ……impossible!” She muttered to herself as her body bent forward. The device inside Minx throbbed. It felt as if something exploded inside her bladder gurgling her pee everywhere. Her thighs slammed together before she could stop them.. “FUCCCCKKK!” She bit down on her lip, cutting off the sound.

A minute passed and she was starting to feel lightheaded. “Holy hell… okay… okay, that was… a lot. But I’m fine. Totally fine. She’s not gonna see me squirm. She’s not gonna see …”

Another click.“DAMN!” It felt like her bladder had just been inflated with a gallon of water. Her toes curled inside her shoes. She was fighting with tooth and nail to not leak. Even though every cell in her body screamed to let go!. She could feel heat coming out of her ears.

“Still bored?” Kinkly asked, leaning on the desk with her chin resting on her hand.

Minx shook violently and forced herself up, “Call me when you’ve got something worth my time.” She countered, a little too fast, compensating for the tremor in her voice.

“Oh my god. I’m going to explode. She is taking it so close to Rex’s level of challenge!”

Kinkly clicked again. Minx’s legs instinctively crossed doubly like a pretzel, wriggling from one side to the other. Her nails scratched her thighs. She couldn’t breathe anymore. Any extra breath meant her floodgates could open. But she still managed to absorb the pressure somehow and slapped her palm on the desk, both to steady herself and to make it look like she was still in the fight.

“Pressure’s at Level 280 now,” Kinkly said, almost sweetly. “Not bad for a school-girl, isn’t it Minx?”

Minx’s pride surface again. She stood up and slowly twirled around. But the sexy arch was replaced with a desperate front arch. Her body was making it’s own choices now and her bulge grotesquely showed through her leotard. “Better than your little toy can handle. You keep clicking, I’ll keep proving you wrong.”

Kinkly hovered over the clicker like a game show host about to reveal the winning answer.

“Ready?” she asked, her tone dripping with faux innocence.

Minx tilted her head, giving a smirk that was just a shade too forced. “Sweetie, I’ve been ready since yesterday. Go ahead. Shock me.” Inside, she was bracing herself, “Just breathe. It’s all mental. If you could survive Rex, you can survive this. You’re not going to break. You’re Minx. This is just another day without a bathroom. Just… another… day.”

Kinkly clicked.

The surge wasn’t a rise. It felt like an explosion. Minx’s bladder spasmed so violently she almost stood up. She gripped the edge of her chair, her knuckles whitening, her jaw clamped to keep from crying out. Her legs crossed in a flash before she remembered herself and forced them apart, though her hips still rolled subtly, fighting the urge to hunch forward.

Her eyes widened, then narrowed, as if she was glaring the sensation into submission. “Ohhh… was that supposed to be the big scary jump? Cute,” she said, though her voice had that tight, high edge of someone trying to talk through clenched teeth. Oh no. No no no. That’s… that’s not cute at all

Kinkly raised a brow. “Hm. Let’s do another.”

“No!” Minx stopped herself. “I mean, no problem. Go ahead.”

Click.

Her back arched involuntarily. Her pee hole stung. Sweat rivulets ran from her shoulder blades through her cleavage. She exhaled hard through her nose, almost growling. “You’re gonna have to try harder than that,” she rasped.

“Try harder? Oh, genius, why did you say that?! My god, I’m going to split in two.”

Hours passed. Click. Click. Click. Each one felt like a hammer blow. She had bathed in her own sweat by now. Her hands kept swaying toward her crotch before she yanked them away again. Kinkly kept glancing at the screen, impressed despite herself.

“You’re still dry? This is the day two, Minx. You are struggling already?”

“I’m just tired...” Minx’s smirk was forced and more defiant than cocky. “Your tiny device is no match for my control.”

Kinkly chuckled. “You want to know how much the pressure’s going up with each click?”

Minx blinked, curious despite herself. “Yeah. Humor me.”

“It depends on the current level,” Kinkly said, tapping the monitor. “The algorithm’s set to increase the pressure by fifty percent each time. So, if you think the last click was bad…” She let the implication hang in the air, smirking. “…the next one’s going to feel like you’re holding back a flood with a paper dam.”

Minx swallowed hard, her pride refusing to let her show fear. “Good. I like when people try to challenge my control.”

Click.

Her toes curled hard. She thought her shoes might tear. She gasped before she could stop herself, hands gripping the arms of the chair, nails digging into the leather. She forced a shaky smile, locking eyes with Kinkly.

“That… all you got?”

Kinkly only smirked and set the clicker down. “I’ve got all night.”

And so, the night went. Click by brutal click. Until the sun rose again and the counter on Kinkly’s screen read Level 720. Minx was still dry except her body was drenched in sweat.

Kinkly sat with the clicker in her lap and eyes fixed on Minx. “You’ve done well,” she said, tone appeasing, “Better than I thought, even. But now? You are appearing to be at your limits.”

Minx knew Kinkly was right. Her legs were already trembling under the desk. She had not let a single drop of pee out over the past three days, and she didn’t want to let any out, yet. Not in front of this bitch! She thought to herself. She leaned back, trying her absolute best to appear casual, but the stutters gave her away.

“I’ll…t- tell you what’s inside me,” she muttered, “Keep clicking but you can never make me p-pee!”

Kinkly’s grinned. “So be it!”

Click.

The shock slammed into her bladder like a battering ram. Minx’s body folded forward. She grunted aloud. She dug her elbows into her thighs as she clenched every last muscle she had. Her teeth ground together.

Don’t leak. Don’t you dare leak. You’re Minx. You don’t leak.

Click.

She gasped and shot upright as if electricity had run through her. Her hips ached. Her sphincters trembled violently. She pressed her heels into the floor. Her hands gripped the armrests hard enough to make her knuckles crack. Her eyes darted to the door. There was nowhere to go, no escape.

Click.

A sharp, almost inhuman spasm hit her. It started from her lady muscles and went all the way up to her navel, like a tsunami within. She half-stood, then immediately sat again, bouncing in place. Her thighs flexed like was in a cyclothon and her knees knocked once before she crossed into a pretzel.

“You’re… trying… too hard,” Minx panted. “It’s not… gonna happen.”

Kinkly just stared, thumb resting on the clicker.

Click.

The pressure shot up again. Minx’s head whipped back. Her hair was sticking to her sweaty face. She grabbed herself for half a second before ripping her hands away in anger. “NO. Not like that. I don’t need that!” It was the first time in three days; she grabbed her crotch. It was a sign that things were going out of control. Her breathing was erratic now. Her sweaty boobs heaved up and down. Her eyes were bloodshot. She rocked forward, then back, fanning her thighs together in short, frantic pulses.

Ohhh it’s right there, I can feel it. NOOO! Hold it. Hold it, damn you.

Click.

Her thighs squished against each other. Heels stomped the floor. She was restless with her fingers clawing the edge of the table like she could tear it in half.

Click.

Her entire lower body quivered, hips grinding in tight, erratic circles. She was moaning now. Half agony, half fury! The room echoed with her gasps and the strain of holding back an unstoppable tide.

Click.

Minx was shaking violently, eyes squeezed shut. “NO. Not today. Not EVER. You hear me?!” Her voice cracked with the effort. She felt like her pee hole was on fire.

Click.

She was half out of her chair now, knees bent, one foot on the floor, the other tapping in short, frantic bursts. She shoved her hands in her crotch, then shot up to clutch her hair instead.

Click.

“GAWD! Kinkly! This is insane!” she yelled, but her pride was still there, “You’ll die before I let go!”

Click.

The hours bled together. By the middle of day three, Minx’s body was a tired and battered. She had rocked, bounced, squeezed her thighs in a thousand combinations, grinding through wave after wave of ungodly pressure. And still, miraculously, impossibly, she hadn’t leaked.

Kinkly watched with a strange awe now. Click.

Minx’s entire body was writhing in spasms and her pee hole felt like it was being stung by bees. Her hands were permanently glued to her crotch, and her forehead was nearly touching the desk. Her bladder was screaming for a relief and contracting violently to push out all the water she consumed during this program. She stayed bent forward, every muscle clamped in iron control, her face scrunched up in determination. Not one drop. Not one drop. Not one! She kept chanting her mantra.

Minx endured the entire daylight. By the evening, she sat curled into herself, both hands gripping the edge of the table and her thighs clamped together. Her lips were parted, drawing in breaths through teeth that clicked every time her body spasmed.

Click.

“Tell me,” Kinkly purred, lounging in her chair with the clicker balanced on her finger. “How do you feel? Is your bladder screaming at you right now?”

Click.

Minx jerked forward. “I—it’s… it’s nothing,” she hissed. “Just… pressure. Nothing I can’t handle.”

“Minx,” Kinkly spoke with a stern voice, “don’t lie to me. I want you to say it. I want you to admit what you’re feeling.”

Minx’s whole body trembled as she shook her head. Sweat dripped from her chin into her cleavage. Her abdomen jutted so grotesquely that she looked pregnant. She bit her lip until it bled. Kinkly leaned in.

“Say it.”

Minx’s jaw clenched furiously. Her voice cracked open like a dam. “I’m BURSTING!” she screamed. “Happy now? My bladder’s… gonna explode!” Her eyes watered. Her voice dropped to a whisper. “I’ve never… needed to pee this bad in my life.”

Kinkly’s smile was slow and cruel. “Mmm. That’s better. The mighty Minx, admitting defeat.”

Minx was fuming at her words. She shook her head violently, strands of hair whipping her damp face.

“Don’t you dare,” she growled. “I haven’t admitted defeat. I am going to hold till your equipment breaks!” She straightened herself upright in the chair, “I’m still holding. I’ve won already. Your little toy has me at level 2169 and guess what..” she pointed at the clicker, “your device is useless on me!”

That made Kinkly freeze. The smile faltered. Then, slowly, it twisted into something darker. “You shouldn’t have said that.” Before Minx could react, Kinkly pressed down on the clicker and snapped a strip of duct tape over it. The clicker was now on a rapid-fire mode. The device whined.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

The levels started climbing, fast. One every second. 2170. 2171. 2172. 2173. The numbers ticked up like a stopwatch.

A chill went down Minx’s spine. “Oh… oh shit.”

The wave hit almost immediately. She doubled over, both hands shoved into her crotch. Her body was bounicing and wiggling in place as the pressure mounted too quickly to adjust. No no no no, I can’t….hold…this fast. It’s rising too fast! Her thoughts scrambled, in pure survival instinct. Clamp down harder! Oh God, harder! Don’t you dare let it go, Minx, tighten, TIGHTEN!”

“Look at you,” Kinkly taunted, her voice almost gleeful. “All that pride, all that arrogance. Let’s see if it can hold against THIS.”

The device kept climbing. 2300. 2400. 2500. The intervals between increases vanished into a blur. Hours passed. The clock on the wall spun through its slow rotations while Minx fought with every ounce of willpower left in her body. Her voice was broken from screaming, her muscles burnt like they were tearing themselves apart. She whispered to herself between her strained intermittent breaths. Just one more second. Just one more. Don’t let her win. You are Minx. You don’t leak. You don’t..

By 3000, she was curled on the floor. Her legs were twisted into a knot and fingers kneading and clawing her swollen labia. She was screaming like a madwoman. Her body jerked violently every time the level ticked upward.

Kinkly sat silently now, her face caught between awe and disbelief. She hadn’t expected Minx to last minutes, let alone hours. But Minx was shattering. Her swollen bladder had pushed her skin-tight shorts to their breaking point quite literally. With a sharp crack, one button snapped loose, flying across the room like a bullet. The waistband gaped helplessly around the humongous bulge beneath. The fabric was stretched to its limits as if begging for mercy. The zipper of her shorts fought vehemently but the metal bent and creaked and finally gave away. Her leotard creaked with every breath; its seams started to rip as Minx writhed and squirmed. Her fingers, locked like claws against her crotch. They were beginning to ache from the pressure of her own grip. Tears rolled down her red cheeks. Her body rocked and writhed, but still, still, she fought. I can’t…no…I must hold…just one more second…one more…”

The clock struck midnight. The counter ticked past 3600.

And Minx finally broke. As the first drop of her boiling pee pushed past her overworked muscles, she screamed aloud. She jolted upright and got back to her chair. She was squirming and writhing, not knowing what to do. Within a split second, she doubled over violently, both hands clamping down on her crotch. But it wasn’t enough. Once the seal was broken there was no going back.

No no no noooooo!

Another spurt escaped. She flung her hand back as pee drenched her leotard and shorts. And that was her undoing. The floodgates opened, rather erupted. It was violent and it roared out of her nether with such force that the piss started gurgling out of her waistband and the leg opening of her leather shorts. It formed a pool in her lap, steaming and bubbling as pee kept gushing out. She held her breath, tried to clench, grab herself but nothing could stop the outburst. The steaming pee splattered against the chair on the floor.

After multiple failed attempts Minx hurriedly sottd up and tore away her clothes, dropping them in the puddle. The moment the barrier was off, the splattering turned into a torrent - a thick straight torrent. She plopped on the chair, forming an arc of pee midair before hitting glass pane. Kinkly stepped back until she realized what was happening. The room echoed with her moans and cries as relief took over her body. The puddle under her chair and the one forming under the glass pane now connected together to form a giant pool. Nearly a minute later, her abdomen finally started deflating, in painful pulses. Her body convulsed through the release, and she had no strength left. She let her body slump in the chair and her hands hung freely.

Another minute passed and Minx collapsed forward onto the desk. Her face was pressed to her forearm. Her body shuddered as the remaining half of the torrent poured out of her. Around three minutes later, the stream finally died. Finally.

Minx felt the device still buzzing inside her. With the load emptied, the device felt extremely hot. She dragged herself to stand and parted her legs and instantly the device jutted out, like an empty shell from a shotgun. Kinkly stood up, craning her neck to see the device bouncing on the floor like a waterless fish. It was still vibrating. Minx slowly hobbled towards it and picked it up. Her lips parted into a smile, with a mix of triumph, relief and sheer astonishment. She held up the device for Kinkly to look. It was bent and distorted. As she twirled it around, it short-circuited suddenly.

“I WON!” Minx mouthed to Kinkly. Deep down she knew she didn’t win but it definitely proved her steel to Kinkly. There’s a first time to everything, isn’t it?
