Hi Omo Lovers! I am back with yet another story about a college girl absolutely obsessed with holding her pee - day in, day out. If you love characters who go to extremes to hide their needs while acting nonchalant then this story is for you. Enjoy!

The First Meet:

When I first stepped into the cramped little room that was going to be our home for the next year, I had one thing on my mind: the bathroom. Five hours of bumping around on a bus, chugging down water to stave off motion sickness—it was a bladder’s worst nightmare. As soon as I dumped my bags on the bed closest to the window, I darted for the tiny, attached bathroom.

“Oh, thank God!” I muttered to myself, the sweet relief almost making me forget that I was in a hostel now, not at home, where I was used to having a bathroom all to myself.

By the time I emerged, feeling like a new person, I had just enough time to finish unpacking before Ada and Tira burst into the room, laughing and out of breath. Both of them went straight to the bathroom as if they'd choreographed it, Tira squeezing in just before Ada.

“Come on, Tira! I’m about to explode!” Ada whined, bouncing on her feet as she waited for her turn.

“Give me two minutes!” Tira called back through the door.

They weren’t kidding about their tiny bladders, I guess.

Anyway, after their emergency bathroom dash, we all settled in, chatting excitedly about classes, the campus, and all the places we wanted to explore once we were done settling in. The room was still missing one thing, though—our fourth roommate, Janhvi. The warden had said she’d arrive by evening, and sure enough, just as the sun was starting to set, Janhvi walked in. She was, for the lack of a better word – HOT! I used to think I would be the hottest girl in the freshman year, but she smoked me right when she entered the room – a tank top fighting for her life; a denim skirt barely reaching her crotch; heels that could put a needle to shame. I didn’t realize how shamelessly I ogled at her till she stopped and at herself. She smirked to herself, all confident, and she had this super laid-back vibe. We all greeted her, and she flashed us a grin, dumping her bags on the last available bed.

“Hey, sorry I’m late. The bus was a nightmare,” Janhvi said casually, stretching her arms over her head like she had all the time in the world. Her tank top was pulled up exposing the straps of her Victoria’s secret and a moderate bulge. I knew it was her bladder yearning for a release or so I thought.

“How long was your bus ride?” I asked out of curiosity.

“It was sixteen hours long!, Shruti! Can you believe it!” she replied with a mild annoyance and polished off the remaining water from her bottle.

“Sixteen?” I blinked at her. “Wait, don’t you need to, uh, you know, use the bathroom? You can go first, before we head out to explore the campus. We’ve all freshened up already.”

Ada and Tira nodded in agreement, obviously still recovering from their own bladder crises earlier.

“Nah, I’m good. I’ll go later.” But Janhvi just waved it off and threw 3 empty water bottles in the bin.

“Later?” My brain couldn’t compute that. Sixteen hours? Three litres of water! Was this girl made of steel? I’d barely survived my five-hour trip without feeling like I was about to burst, and here she was, acting like sixteen hours was nothing.

“Are you sure? We’ve been snacking, too,” I added, eyeing the bottle of juice she’d brought in with her.

“Yep, I’m fine,” she said, grabbing her phone. “Let’s go!”

I couldn’t shake it, though. As we walked around campus, munching on snacks, sipping juices, and even downing a couple of glasses of water with dinner later, I kept sneaking glances at Janhvi. The rest of us were feeling it; Ada and Tira both excused themselves twice during our outing to go find a bathroom. Even I was holding off, but just barely. By the time we got back to the room, I was at my limit. I raced into the bathroom first, hearing Ada’s exaggerated groan behind me. “Shruti! Not fair! I called dibs!”

“Sorry, emergency!” I called over my shoulder as I shut the door. No way was I going to risk waiting any longer. Five hours of bus ride and now the evening’s hydration? No, thanks. When I finally emerged, refreshed and relieved, I saw Janhvi still lounging on her bed, scrolling through her phone laying on her belly! Like nothing was out of the ordinary.

“Janhvi, the bathroom’s free if you need it,” I said, trying not to sound too nosy, but I couldn’t help it. “Surely” she had to be feeling it by now?

“Oh, I think I’ll just take a shower,” she said, grabbing her towel and heading in.

I watched her disappear into the bathroom, frowning slightly. “Just a shower?” That’s it? Not even a quick pee after, what, almost an entire day of travel? Something wasn’t adding up. I lay back on my bed, trying not to think about it, but the thought nagged at me like an itch I couldn’t scratch. Even when Janhvi emerged from the bathroom a good fifteen minutes later, towel-drying her hair, there was one thing that stood out: I didn’t hear the flush. At all. Not even a little hint of water swirling down the drain.

“Did she… not… go?” I couldn’t ask, of course. That would be insane, right? You don’t just ask someone if they peed. But how could she possibly have waited this long? I mean, a day-long bus ride, then all those drinks, and not even a single visit to the bathroom. That night, as I lay in bed, my mind raced merely thinking that this girl was holding it for a solid 21 hours without flinching. I was suddenly on a mission—a mission to figure out what was up with Janhvi’s bathroom habits. Or lack thereof.

The next few days only made things stranger. I started paying closer attention. Every time Ada and Tira would rush off to pee—usually every couple of hours—I’d casually glance over at Janhvi, who would be lounging around, completely unfazed. And then there was me, still proud of my bladder capacity, thinking I was a pro because I could last five, maybe seven hours if I really pushed it. But Janhvi? She was on another level. Three days went by, and I never saw her use the bathroom at all. She’d go in, take a shower or wash her face, but that was it. It was like her bladder was a bottomless pit.

“Do you guys ever wonder how Janhvi never needs to pee?” I asked Ada and Tira one night, unable to hold in my curiosity any longer.

Ada looked up from her textbook, scrunching her nose. “Now that you mention it… yeah, she never really rushes like we do, huh?”

“She’s like a camel,” Tira chimed in with a giggle. “Storing it all up for later.”

I laughed along with them, but internally, I was still baffled. How was she doing this? Was it some kind of secret bladder training? A hidden talent? Was there a Guinness World Record for longest time without peeing? Because Janhvi would probably win it.

We still had a few days before the classes started and we all explored the locality and all. One night, after we’d all returned from a particularly fun evening out—filled with snacks, drinks, and a lot of walking—I couldn’t help myself. Ada and Tira had already darted off to the hostel bathrooms like clockwork, and I was about to follow when I turned to Janhvi, who was casually stretching by her bed, her bladder bulging under her tight shorts.

“Janhvi,” I blurted out, “Seriously, do you NEVER pee?”

She looked at me, one eyebrow raised, and then smiled that casual, laid-back smile of hers. “That would be a dream”

“WHAT!?” My jaws dropped to the floor.

“N-no!” Her face turned red. “I mean, it’s more convenient to not go…”

Kind of convenient? - This girl was basically a superhero, and she was acting like it was no big deal!

 

Classes Begin:

A few days after my initial discovery of Janhvi’s superhuman bladder, I decided I needed answers. I mean, how long could she actually hold it? Surely she could never, ‘never’ go? I was officially on a mission to find out. And what better day to start than on the first day of classes? We all got up early that morning, grabbing our stuff and heading to the campus cafeteria for breakfast. As usual, Ada and Tira disappeared to the bathroom right after they finished eating, but Janhvi? Nope. Not even a glance in that direction. She just casually filled up her giant 2-litre water bottle at the water station, like she was preparing for a hike in the desert.

I gave her a curious look. “You’re really going to carry that around all day?”

She nodded, completely unfazed. “Yeah, I get thirsty a lot.”

I couldn’t help but smirk. “What if you need to go during the classes?”

Janhvi just shrugged, taking a big gulp of water. “OH Shruti! That will never happen.”

But I didn’t say anything more. Instead, I decided today was going to be the day I cracked the mystery of Janhvi’s bladder once and for all.

By lunchtime, I’d already downed my small bottle of water and felt a slight pressure building, but I was determined to keep pace with Janhvi. She, on the other hand, was halfway through her second 2-litre bottle without breaking a sweat. As we sat at the cafeteria, finishing our food, I glanced over at her. Not a single sign of discomfort. In fact, she seemed perfectly content, sipping away and chatting about classes like we hadn’t been hydrating ourselves to the point of bursting. Ada and Tira, of course, excused themselves again to go find the bathroom.

“Back in five,” Tira said, practically jogging out of the cafeteria.

Meanwhile, Janhvi just refilled her water bottle for the second time. My eyes widened. “She’s really going for round two?” I thought, my mind whirling. I wanted to hold it too, but the pressure was getting too much. When the first spurt leaked, I excused myself to the bathroom before we resumed the classes. I kept stealing glances at her all afternoon, trying to catch any signs—crossed legs, fidgeting, anything. But nothing. The girl was a rock. When the last class finally ended, I was “ready” to make a dash to the bathroom again, but Janhvi? Oh, she had other plans.

“Hey, Shruti, I’m headed to the gym. Wanna come?”

I hesitated. Gym? After all that water? “Seriously?” But my curiosity got the better of me. “Sure, I’ll come,” I replied, trying to keep my cool. Maybe I’d finally see her crack. At the gym, Janhvi went straight to the treadmill, setting it to a brisk pace. I couldn’t help but notice her midsection as she started jogging. Her belly was clearly swollen, bulging against the waistband of her gym shorts or dare I say panties. And yet, she acted like nothing was wrong. She even paused to chug more water from her giant bottle before continuing her run. Meanwhile, I was losing it. Not from my own bladder—I was fine for now—but from sheer disbelief. How was she doing this? I glanced at the clock. “It’s been over ten hours.” And she was still going strong.

We wrapped up at the gym after about an hour, and I thought, “Surely, this is it. She’ll have to go now.” But no. Janhvi casually refilled her bottle yet again and chugged half of it. Then she took a hot shower and came out still with that bulge of hers. She continued to chat with me as she struggled to button her tight shorts but she sucked her belly in and buttoned it up like it was nothing. By that time, I had peed once again already. More was yet to come. She suggested we hit the library to study. “The library?!” I thought. I was almost starting to feel uncomfortable on her behalf. But I went along with it, of course, determined to see how far she’d push herself.

In the library, things got even more surreal. Janhvi was on her third refill of the day— “third!”—and she was just chilling, flipping through her notes, completely unbothered. I kept sneaking glances at her waistband, which was visibly cutting into her bloated belly now. I could see the indentation on her skin. And still, not a single sign of discomfort. I couldn’t concentrate on my own studies. How could I? This girl was breaking the laws of biology right in front of me. Every time she shifted in her seat, I half-expected her to finally get up and head to the bathroom, but no. Janhvi just kept sipping water and scribbling notes like nothing was out of the ordinary.

By the time dinner rolled around, I was on the verge of losing my mind. We all sat together in the hostel cafeteria, and while Ada and Tira excused themselves for the umpteenth time to go pee, Janhvi was still sitting there, eating her food and refilling her glass of water like it was no big deal. I couldn’t help myself anymore. “Janhvi,” I blurted out, lowering my voice so the others wouldn’t hear, “I shouldn’t ask this, but you haven’t gone once today!”

She looked at me with that same relaxed smile she always had. “It just skipped my mind. I will go later anyways.”

“Skipped my mind?” Her waistband was practically digging into her skin, her belly was swollen like she’d eaten a whole watermelon, and she didn’t give a fuck.

I nodded slowly, trying to process this. “Okay, if you say so…”

When we got back to our room, Ada and Tira immediately made their usual bathroom dash while Janhvi threw herself on her bed, lying on her stomach to watch Netflix. “On her stomach.” With her bulging bladder pressing into the mattress. I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to discuss this with Ada & Tira. Later that night, after Janhvi had gone to bed—still without peeing, mind you—I pulled Ada and Tira aside, my voice barely a whisper.

“Guys,” I said, “you’re not going to believe this, but Janhvi hasn’t peed all day.”

Ada blinked at me. “WHAT!”

“She hasn’t gone to the bathroom. At all. Since this morning. I’ve been watching her. She drank, like, three of that giant water bottles, finished the classes, went to the gym, studied in the library… and nothing!”

Tira’s eyes widened. “No way. That’s impossible.”

“I’m serious! Her belly’s all swollen, and she doesn’t even care! She’s literally lying on her stomach right now, like it’s no big deal.”

Ada looked at me, half in shock, half in disbelief. “Is she part-camel or something?”

“I don’t know, but I swear, it’s like her bladder has no limits.”

Tira shook her head, looking both impressed and embarrassed. “I can barely go three hours without rushing to the bathroom, and she’s just... chilling.”

We all stood there in stunned silence for a moment, trying to wrap our heads around it.

Ada finally broke the silence. “We need to keep an eye on her. This has to be some kind of record.”

Tira nodded. “Agreed. I’m curious now.”

And just like that, the three of us made an unspoken pact to watch Janhvi even more closely. Because, seriously, what was going on with her? As I climbed into bed that night, I couldn’t help but feel like I was living with some kind of bladder superhero. A very, very casual superhero who didn’t seem to care that she was defying all logic.

Hi guys! Next part is here as promised ;-)

Sneaky Sneaky:

After a few more weeks of living with Janhvi, I thought I’d seen everything when it came to her bladder. The way she could casually sip water all day without ever making a trip to the bathroom was almost superhuman. But then, Ada, Tira, and I started noticing something weird: Janhvi did go to the bathroom—but only when we were all fast asleep. It started when Tira woke up early one morning to grab a glass of water. She had gone into the bathroom and heard a soft click of the door opening just after she left. Confused, she peered out and saw Janhvi slip inside, looking groggy and—get this—annoyed. Like, she was actually frustrated about having to pee.

The next day, Tira told us everything.

“I swear, she was mumbling to herself,” Tira said over breakfast, leaning in conspiratorially. “Like she was mad about it. I didn’t want to eavesdrop, but I could hear her grumbling something like, ‘Why now? Couldn’t hold it till morning?’”

Ada’s fork froze halfway to her mouth. “Wait, she cursed herself for needing to pee? What kind of person gets mad about that?”

“Janhvi, apparently,” Tira replied, wide-eyed. “And when she finally did… go, it was like—” Tira lowered her voice, glancing around to make sure no one else in the cafeteria was listening, “—she went forever. For a minute I thought she had left the faucet open but no. It was Janhvi, going on and on and on.”

I choked on my coffee. “She was emptying a whole day’s worth! That’s exactly what she does. I’ve been watching her—she doesn’t go during the day at all.”

Ada’s eyes widened. “That’s… that’s insane. I thought maybe she just had really good control, but one pee a day? No way.”

We all sat there, trying to process it. I mean, I had been suspecting something along those lines for weeks, but now that it was confirmed, it felt even more unreal. We decided to test our theory. The next night, after we went to bed, I stayed up a little later than usual, scrolling through my phone in the dark. Sure enough, around 2 AM, I heard soft footsteps, and the bathroom door click open. Janhvi had slipped out of bed and, like Tira said, she looked irritated, rubbing her eyes and muttering under her breath.

“Why the fuck can’t I hold an extra hour!,” she mumbled as she shut the bathroom door.

And then, from behind the thin bathroom walls, I heard it. The unmistakable sound of water hitting the toilet—only it kept going. And going. And going. I lay there, wide-eyed, staring at the ceiling. How was this even possible? It was like she was releasing a waterfall. Finally, I heard the flush, followed by a sigh from Janhvi as she washed her hands and came back into the room. I lay perfectly still as she climbed back into bed, thinking that was the end of it, but no. I heard the faint glug-glug-glug of her water bottle as she chugged down at least half of it—probably a litre—before she settled back under the covers. It was like she was preparing herself to be full by morning, ensuring she had enough in her system to last the entire next day.

A few days passed like that. Janhvi never used the bathroom during the day—like, NEVER —but eventually, after days of observation and a lot of late-night whispering between the three of us, we cracked the code. She only went to the bathroom in the dead of night, when she thought everyone was fast asleep. Around 3 or 4 AM, she’d quietly slip out of bed, grumbling to herself, and disappear into the bathroom. I’d heard her a few times, just by chance, and let me tell you, it was *intense*. The thin bathroom doors didn’t do much to muffle the sound, and when she finally let go, it seemed to go on forever. Like, “forever”. She was in there so long that I started timing it one night—three full minutes of continuous peeing. I mean, how was that even possible? The kicker? She didn’t seem happy about it. Every time, I’d hear her cursing under her breath, like she was annoyed that her bladder had finally reached its limit.

“Damn it, I thought I’d make it little longer,” she’d mutter, clearly frustrated with herself.

One day Ada commented, “What will happen if we interrupt her in the night?” I was sceptical, but I had to admit, I was dying to see how Janhvi would handle it. Would she get annoyed? Would she give up and hold it even longer? It was like we were testing the limits of human endurance, and Janhvi was our very unwilling participant. We planned a coup and that night, we all pretended to fall asleep. Around 3 AM, we heard Janhvi stir from her bed clearly preparing for her usual nighttime bathroom run. I perked up, listening closely. Sure enough, right on cue, Ada started shifting in her bed too. Ada slid out of bed, pretending to yawn loudly as she shuffled toward the bathroom door. I could barely contain my excitement. This was it—the moment of truth.

Janhvi froze. I could hear the soft rustle of her blanket as she sat up, probably realizing that her window of opportunity was being closed by Ada’s fake emergency.

“Hey, Janhvi,” Ada said in a sleepy voice, “I, uh, really need to pee. You mind if I go first?”

In the dim light, I could see Janhvi blinking at Ada, her face a mix of surprise and—was that relief? “Oh, sure. Go ahead.”

Ada disappeared into the bathroom, and we all held our breath. What would Janhvi do now? I peeked over at her, expecting her to fidget, to maybe reconsider her life choices. But no. Janhvi just sat back, completely calm, waiting for her turn like it was no big deal. In fact, when Ada finally came out a few minutes later, Janhvi got up, stretched, and casually grabbed her water bottle. She chugged the whole litre, right in front of us, while we exchanged shocked glances. We expected her to head to the bathroom after downing that much water, but instead, she just put the empty bottle on her nightstand and went back to bed, again laying on her swollen belly like nothing was wrong. I lay there in disbelief, staring at the ceiling. “She’s really not going to pee?” I thought. Ada, too, was clearly stunned, her eyes wide as she climbed back into bed.

“What just happened?” Ada whispered, barely able to comprehend what we’d just seen.

“She didn’t even try to go,” I muttered back, shaking my head. “And she drank more water!”

Tira, who had stayed quiet this whole time, finally chimed in. “How is she not wet by now?”

None of us had an answer. Janhvi was a mystery we couldn’t figure out.

The next morning, we all woke up groggily, except for Janhvi, who seemed as fresh as ever. She stretched and casually got out of bed, her belly swollen significantly larger from all the water she’d consumed the day before. The rest of us watched in silence, waiting for her to make a beeline for the bathroom. But of course, she didn’t. Instead, she just sat on the bed for a minute or two longer than otherwise. She then she grabbed her now-empty water bottle and refilled it without a second thought, taking a long sip like she hadn’t just downed an entire litre a few hours earlier.

“Morning, guys,” she said cheerfully, completely oblivious to the stares she was getting from the three of us.

I couldn’t help it—I had to ask. “Janhvi, you wanna pop to the bathroom before we step out? You look rather full…”

Janhvi looked at me with mild confusion, like the thought hadn’t even crossed her mind. “Nah, I’m fine.”

“Fine?” I glanced at Ada and Tira, who looked equally baffled.

“But you haven’t gone since yesterday,” Tira pointed out, her voice filled with disbelief. “And you drank all that water.”

Janhvi just shrugged. “Yeah, but I don’t really feel like going yet. It’s no big deal.”

At this point, I was beyond curious. It wasn’t just that she had a huge bladder—it was like she had no sense of urgency at all. And now, with her belly still visibly bloated from holding it in, she was still acting like it was nothing. I leaned in, whispering to Ada and Tira, “We need to figure out how long she can actually hold it. I mean, this is insane.”

Tira nodded, her eyes wide with a mix of awe and shock. “We should test her today. See how far she can go.”

So, that day, the three of us made it our mission to get Janhvi to her breaking point. First things first: breakfast. We all headed to the cafeteria, and I made sure to subtly encourage Janhvi to drink more water.

“Hey, Janhvi,” I said casually as we sat down with our trays, “It’s so hot today.. I really hope I don’t dehydrate.”

“Thanks for reminding me,” Janhvi agreed without hesitation, heading over to the water station to top off her bottle. I couldn’t believe how easy it was. As we ate, Janhvi happily sipped away, making quick work of her second refill of the morning. Meanwhile, Ada and Tira exchanged looks, clearly as amazed as I was. Her belly was still swollen from the night before, and now she was just adding more water to it, like it didn’t even matter.

After breakfast, we had classes. We made sure to sit near Janhvi all day, keeping a close eye on her. By lunchtime, she’d already finished another full bottle, and her waistband was digging into her skin even more noticeably. I had to hand it to her—she didn’t seem bothered at all, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that she had to be feeling SOMETHING.

“Girls does anyone want anything to drink?” Tira suggested as we walked toward the cafeteria.

“Tira could you get me a large fruit punch. Forgot to carry cash today..,” Janhvi said, still so casual. I watched in awe as she filled up her bottle again, taking a long sip before sitting down with her tray.

“Don’t you ever get uncomfortable from drinking so much water?” I asked her, genuinely curious as Tira handed the fruit juice to her. It appeared more like a fishbowl to me.

Janhvi looked at me, a little surprised by the question. “Sometimes, I feel like I should really take a pee…” There she mentioned that she needed to pee. “But then I get lazy and forget it.” She completed her sentence.

How can she FORGET it? I couldn’t believe it. I was starting to get uncomfortable just watching her at this point. The button of her shorts was fighting to stay in the hole and waistband was cutting into her skin and yet she sat there sipping her water like she had all the room in the world. By the time classes ended that day, I was expecting Janhvi to show some signs of discomfort, but she was still her usual laid-back self. Just some minor leg crossing here and there. Ada, Tira, and I were getting impatient now.

“Let’s grab some snacks before heading back,” I suggested as we passed the campus café. “We’ve earned it after today’s classes.”

“Oh yes! I am so thirsty,” Janhvi said, following us in. I ordered a smoothie, while Janhvi opted for—of course—another massive bottle of water. We all grabbed our drinks and headed back to the hostel, Janhvi sipping away as we walked. Once we got to the room, I could barely contain my curiosity. “Janhvi, you’ve had, like, a tonne of water today. Do you really never pee?”

Janhvi glanced down at her belly, which was noticeably bloated now, her waistband practically cutting into her skin. She gave a little shrug. “I mean, I guess I could pee a little, but I don’t want to go so soon. It’s ok to not pee you know…”

I was stunned. How was she not feeling it? Her bladder had to be the size of a watermelon by now! That evening, as we sat down for dinner, I was sure we’d reached the tipping point. Janhvi had been drinking water all day, snacking, and only now she seemed to be a little rigid. Her belly was visibly swollen, pressing out against her clothes, and her movements were slower, yet she still wouldn’t run to the bathroom. Ada, Tira, and I exchanged looks as we ate, silently wondering if today would finally be the day we saw Janhvi crack.

As we finished dinner, Ada couldn’t resist asking one more time. “Janhvi, seriously, how are you still holding it? Teach me…”

Janhvi laughed lightly, as if the whole thing was just amusing. “I guess I’ve just gotten used to waiting.. It’s not that bad.”

“Not that bad?” Tira blurted out, her eyes wide. “Your bladder must be about to burst!”

Janhvi smirked, taking another sip from her ever-present water bottle. “I don’t think I will ever get ‘bursting’. I don’t know I may probably go tomorrow.” But the way she said it didn’t sound convincing. It sounded like she wanted to hold longer.

Back in the room that night, we all settled into bed. I, Ada & Tira decided to wakeup at 3 again to catch her going to the bathroom but we were so tired that we failed to wake up. The next morning, we saw Janhvi sporting her washboard flat belly chilling in her skimpy top and thong. I, Tira & Ada looked at each other with mixed expressions. We were happy that we nearly cracked the mystery and frustrated that we missed to hear her long gusher. But we were not going to stop so easily...

Hi Omo Lovers! Thank you for is much love. Here's the next part! Enjoy...

Gotcha!

After that incident, it became clear that Janhvi was clearly pushing their limits. But it wasn’t until this incident when we realized what Janhvi was up to. It all started when the warden told us that we needed to temporarily shift to a different room for a few days. Apparently, there was some maintenance work being done on our floor, and we’d have to move out while they sorted things out. It was only for three days, she said, and they’d assigned us to a room on a different floor in the meantime. We didn’t think much of it —until we realized the new room didn’t have a bathroom. Instead, we’d have to use the common bathrooms down the hall. For Ada, Tira, and me, this was mildly inconvenient, but nothing we couldn’t handle. But for Janhvi, it was going to be interesting.

I’ll be honest, when we first moved into the new room, I thought Janhvi would break her ridiculous holding habits. I mean, the common bathrooms were still right there, and surely she couldn’t hold it for three days on end, right? It seemed like the perfect opportunity for her to actually USE a bathroom like a normal person. But of course, I was wrong.

The first day started off pretty normal. We settled into our new room, and after the initial complaints about the lack of a bathroom (mostly from Ada and Tira), we went about our day. Janhvi, as always, didn’t seem bothered by the change at all. As I glanced at her flat belly I guessed she took a gusher earlier at dawn while we were asleep. Throughout the day Janhvi and we went about our usual schedule. By this time, we all knew Janhvi was not going to pee even if she was not actively pushing herself.

It was the second day when things started to get more exciting. After spending the whole previous day without using the bathroom, Janhvi still hadn’t made a move to relieve herself. When she woke up her belly was definitely swollen, but she ignored it like nothing was wrong. The first half of the day went by quickly and Janhvi was already on her second refill of her two-litre bottle. I could tell she was starting to feel it, though. Her movements were slower, more calculated, and there was a stiffness to the way she walked. After lunch, Ada and Tira went to the bathrooms again, and this time, I decided to ask Janhvi more directly.

“Janhvi, you don’t need to go?” I asked, just to see her reaction.

She shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. “Nah, it’s fine. I’ll go later.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Later? As in the common bathroom?”

Janhvi shrugged, completely unbothered. “Oh damn! I forgot. Looks like I have nowhere to go.”

Ada, coming back from her own bathroom break, overheard and raised her eyebrows. “What do you mean you YOU-HAVE-NOWHERE-TO-GO. If it’s urgent JUST GOOOO. You haven’t gone since we moved to the new room!”

Janhvi just shrugged again, as if it didn’t matter in the slightest. “Ada just chill babe. I don’t like to…GO...everyday”

That was Janhvi for you. Always “fine.” Always “later.” But I couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that she wasn’t just putting it off—she was deliberately CHOOSING to hold it.

By the time we finished the classes Janhvi had gone through her 3rd refill and maybe a few other beverages. Surely it was taking a toll on her. Janhvi’s carefree or dare I say cocky attitude was slowly withering. Her face was red, and her gait was way too stiff. I asked her if she would like to come to the gym. She hesitated before answering. I couldn’t believe it until I looked at her belly. Her hesitation came from her eye-wateringly swollen bladder and her jeans trying to force it to the inch of its life. When I coaxed her, she agreed to accompany me.

But at the gym, I sensed Janhvi was not her usual self. She was taking longer gaps between her sets and her legs subtly kept shifting her weight from one foot to the other. I thought it would be any moment when she would run for the bathroom, but she remained steadfast and completed all her exercises. Though the last few sets were more rushed and frantic. I could see she was forcing herself to finish her protein shake as if trying to teach her bladder a lesson. Even after returning to the room, she refused to cut down on her intake. The poor girl was squirming in her bed trying to find a comfortable position, but nothing seemed to work.

And then, later that night, I overheard her on the phone speaking to someone in whispers.

“I’m still holding it,” Janhvi whispered into her phone as we all pretended to be asleep. “Yeah, the common bathrooms are right there, but I don’t want to use them. I want my old bathroom...”

She paused, listening to the response, and then giggled softly. “I know.. I’m definitely under a lot of pressure but I don’t think it can break me.” Another pause, and then she added, “I promise, I won’t ask you for it..”

The next morning, I told Ada and Tira what I’d overheard.

“She’s seriously trying to hold it for three days?” Tira asked, eyes wide with disbelief.

“She SAID she would hold it until we’re back in the regular room,” I explained, “And someone knows about her habit too.”

Ada let out a low whistle. “That’s… insane. She’s going to be holding it for three days straight.”

“And she’s acting like it’s no big deal,” Tira added, clearly in awe.

We all glanced over at Janhvi at the breakfast table, casually scrolling through her phone as if she hadn’t been holding for more than two days now. Her movements were slow, deliberate, and there was a constant tension in her body. Her belly was visibly distended, pressing out against her tight skirt, and I could tell that every step she took required concentration. Still, she kept up the act and like clockwork she finished yet another refill by lunch time. Every time Ada, Tira, or I asked if she needed to use the bathroom, she just shrugged it off with excuses.

“It’s fine,” she’d say when we asked. “I can manage.”

Or, “It’s just a few more hours. No point in going now.”

And, of course, my personal favourite: “It’s a waste of time.”

A “waste of time?” She’d been holding it in for two days, and now she was acting like going to the bathroom was beneath her. I couldn’t believe it.

When the classes ended, Janhvi was practically desperate. She moved slowly, her face tense with concentration, and her belly was swollen to the point where it looked uncomfortable just to stand. She unbuttoned her miniskirt, but it still clung to her hips just as tightly. Her jaws were clenched, and fists closed tightly. Her eyes fluttered as she adjusted to the onslaught of waves.

“Janhvi, gym?” I poked her. It was the first time I saw panic in her eyes.

“J-just give me 1 minute.” She stuttered and stepped away from me to call someone. Me being me, stepped closer to her. I had never heard so strained ever before.

“Yeah, still holding it,” she whispered, her voice tight. “It’s getting harder. Can I s-skip the gym today?” Another pause, before she continued, “Babe, please. I haven’t gone in 63 hours.” My eyes popped out in awe as I heard the stat. “Ok…I hear you. You’re right. I will be strong.”

There she took the bait, and she trudged behind me to the gym. I forced her to do the legs routine. One after the other she performed her reps but when it came to the bench press she was in tears. Her body shuddered as she took the position. I loaded the weights and unlocked the bar. Her face scrunched up – red with strain and blue with holding her breath. She looked at me and squeaked. At first I couldn’t understand but she was trying to signal to me to pull the bar up. Of course, I pretended to not understand but then I saw the impossible happen. A big spurt leaked into her neon underwear. “Helppp me Shruti!” She cried. I froze for a minute as my eyes fell on her leaking crotch. Janhvi was unrecognizable at that moment. She fought with all her might to prevent any more spurts from coming out. Her labia quivered under the translucent fabric. Tears rolled down her cheek as she begged me to help her out.

When I pulled her out of the equipment, she immediately lied on the floor. Her hands tightly gripped on her thighs. She was sweaty and writhing as she fought the waves from within. I heard her mutter curses and breathe sharply through her teeth. Her body shined under those gym lights highlighting every cut and contour of her chiselled body.

“Janhvi you really need to pee! Just go now!” I kneeled close to her.

But Janhvi shocked me with her response. “No...It’s just a w-wave. I can h-hold it.”

It was a treat to watch her walk back towards our room. To her utter dismay even Ada joined us on our way. With one glance she could figure out Janhvi was hanging by a thread. “Janhvi, are you SURE you don’t want to go?”

Janhvi just gave a small, tight smile. “No.. I..I must wait until later.” And with that, we all walked back to our room—Janhvi still unrelieved, still refusing to give in, and still determined to prove just how strong her bladder really was. It was both impressive and completely baffling, and I couldn’t help but wonder: just how long would Janhvi keep this up and who was behind all this?

Later that night Janhvi was again on her phone, “Babe..p-please..I need help.” She eagerly nodded as the person on the other side spoke. It seemed he was angry. “I know it will be three days…but by that time the girls will be up” I was shocked to hear it, “I don’t want to go in front of them.. and…I can’t hold it for three more hours either.” She rubbed her tears and tilted her head backward. She leaned against the wall letting her body slouch forward to allow her pregnant like her bulge more room. “Yes yes… I agree. I will obey your rule. But please allow me to pee…”

I don’t know what the other person said but he definitely sounded very commanding. She profusely thanked him and bolted out of the room.

“Looks like we finally found her limits.” Tira, who too was awake, whispered to me.

“And we also need to find who the mystery guy is.” Ada added.

We were on a new mission now.

Your place or Mine: After we moved back into our original room, we started noticing that Janhvi would sneak out of her when we fell asleep. At first, we thought she was just going for a late-night walk or something, but then we started noticing other things. We’d hear her moving around at strange hours, slipping out of the room and coming back right before dawn. Like, her phone ringtone changed to more romantic ones, her fragrances changed to more sultry ones. Her clothes, well, she was not ‘REMOTELY DEMURE’ to begin with, but now she was flaunting herself like a centrefold babe. No more loose clothes; strutting on high heels; skirts that seemed toddler sized and an obscene amount of cleavage always on display. When we asked her about it she became super defensive. Keeping her wardrobe and drawers always locked; hid her laptop and mobile from us.

And finally, one day we realized what she was up to. It was the night before St. Valentine’s. We overheard her on the phone, talking in hushed tones, her voice unusually soft and affectionate. “That last night before our room got renovated, if you hadn’t saved me I may have fled from the college... You are my hero. I promise that one day I will be able to hold it just as long as you. I love you…” I almost dropped my phone when I first heard that. “Wait, what?” Was she talking about what I thought she was talking about? Ada and Tira heard it too, and we all exchanged glances from our beds, our eyes wide with disbelief.

“The mystery guy is her BOYFRIEND! How could we be so DUMB!” Tira whisper yelled to us.

Over the next few days, we saw a few more things unfold. For one, Janhvi’s body language had changed - SIGNIFICANTLY. She was still as cool and laid-back as ever on the outside, but there was something stiffer about her composure. Her usually casual stroll had a certain tension to it, like she was forcing herself to act normally and stay calm. And her belly? Well, that was another story.

Before this saga of room-renovation, there would still be times when she would sport her washboard flat abs but nowadays there was ALWAYS a bulge being compressed under the waistbands. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Janhvi had stopped peeing even once-a-day. Ever since she started dating, it was like she’d taken things to a new level, her determination to hold it in going beyond anything we’d seen before. And the crazy part? She didn’t seem to mind. If anything, she seemed to ENJOY it. One night, after Janhvi had snuck out again, I leaned over to Ada and Tira. “Have you guys noticed anything different about her?”

Ada nodded immediately. “She’s definitely holding it longer. I don’t think I’ve seen her use the bathroom in WEEKS.”

“Right?” I whispered, shaking my head in disbelief. “And now with her boyfriend doing it too, it’s like she’s got a whole system.”

Tira was quiet for a moment, then she sighed. “Do you think she’s holding it for over 48 hours now? I mean, she sneaks out every alternate night?”

I bit my lip, my brain scrambling to do the math. “That would explain why she’s so stiff. I mean, she can’t possibly be comfortable especially after drinking bucket loads of water every day.”

“But I want to know – WHEN OR WHERE DOES SHE PEE?” Tira’s brows were furrowed with confusion.

The next morning, Janhvi returned to the room just before dawn, her usual routine. But this time, I couldn’t help but pay closer attention. Her movements were more deliberate, almost cautious. Her belly was visibly swollen, the waistband of her thong and her miniskirt were digging into her skin. She slipped back into bed, and I could hear her mumbling softly on the phone. Through the dim light of the dawn, I saw her silhouette. She laid on her belly and put her hand underneath. Was she grabbing herself? Her legs were crossed tightly and body stiff. Her head hung low.

“That was just a wave. Please babe…Trust me, I can still hold it,” she whispered, and I nearly choked. “I promise I can wait till tomorrow morning.”

I blinked in the darkness. “Tomorrow morning?” I waited until she fell asleep before whispering to Ada and Tira. “She’s going for tomorrow morning. She’s holding it for another day.”

Ada’s eyes were wide as saucers. “How is that even possible?”

“Yes, she hasn’t peed for two fucking days! She is looking like she’s pregnant,” Tira muttered, “Her bladder must be screaming by now.”

That day, we decided to watch Janhvi even more closely. Janhvi was doing everything in her power to act cool, even as her bladder threated to rip her skirt to shreds. Her gait was very unnatural, and her bulge was eye-wateringly big. Her legs were never still and face burning red. “I wonder how did she button up that denim skirt!” Ada commented. Janhvi walked much slower, and she definitely seemed a bit more focused, but other than that, she was just… normal. If she stopped to talk to anyone she would immediately relax herself and act all animated, like holding it in for over 2 days was no big deal.

Janhvi hurriedly refilled her 2-litre water bottle at lunch, her movements more panicky than usual. I had a feeling something was up. As soon as the bottle was full, she disappeared behind the building, waddling all the way. I could see how tense her legs were. Ada, Tira, and I exchanged looks—we were used to seeing Janhvi pull stunts with her bladder, but this seemed… different.

“Let’s go see what she’s up to,” Ada whispered, her curiosity clearly getting the better of her. We all nodded and quietly followed her, keeping a good distance to stay out of sight. When we rounded the corner, we saw her: Janhvi, standing under the shade of a huge tree, and next to her—HIM. A tall fit guy with an equally massive water bottle. We couldn’t see his face properly because of the branches and shadows, but there was no doubt: this was the mysterious boyfriend she had been holding her pee for all this time. If he could make Janhvi swoon there must have been something truly special about him and he sure did.

As soon as they met, they started chugging water looking at each other knowingly. It was some sort of bizarre competition. The guy lifted his bottle with ease, downing it in long, effortless gulps, while Janhvi hesitated for just a second before trying to match his pace. Her hand gripped the bottle tightly as she raised it to her lips, but she wasn’t anywhere near as confident. She’d barely finished a quarter of it when she bent over, shoving her hand between her legs. We couldn’t believe our eyes. She paused for a moment, then tried again, forcing herself to drink more, but her body was clearly protesting.

Ada nudged me. “Look at her. She’s gonna explode.”

I nodded, my heart pounding in disbelief. She wasn’t just holding it now—she was trying to push her limits even more and it was obvious she was losing the battle. Janhvi lowered the bottle, panting slightly. Her face was flushed, and she looked at him, pleading. We were too far to hear exactly what she was saying, but her body language said it all. “I can’t… It’s too much…” She looked worried, her eyes shut tightly and her body shuddering. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. He was calm, smiling down at her proudly patting his bulge with an almost encouraging expression. And then, just when I thought he might force her to finish the bottle, he leaned in and gave her a long, slow kiss.

We watched, dumbfounded and envious, as Janhvi squirmed in his embrace as he kissed her, like he was rewarding her for her efforts. When he finally pulled away, he smiled again—this time with a look of satisfaction, like he was HAPPY with her determination, with how far she had pushed herself. “I don’t know how are you still holding it…I really wish I were strong like you…”

We held our breath, waiting for what would happen next. Would he make her drink the rest of the bottle? Would she keep going? But no. He simply waved to her and turned to leave. We all blinked in shock. “Did that just happen?” Tira muttered, her voice barely above a whisper.

“Yeah… but if she couldn’t finish her bottle...she must really be at her absolute limits,” Ada pointed out, still staring at Janhvi, whose bulge appeared more like a cantaloupe now.

Janhvi, now alone, slowly lowered herself onto a nearby bench. As soon as she sat down, she crossed her legs tightly—tighter than I’d ever seen—wrapping them around each other like a pretzel. She bent forward and hung her head low. Her crossed legs furiously bobbed up and down as she fought wave after wave. We watched from behind the bushes, our eyes glued to her. Janhvi wasn’t fidgeting anymore—she was downright frantic, her body shifting every few seconds as she tried to get comfortable.

How is she doing this?” Ada muttered under her breath.

“I have no idea,” I replied, shaking my head. “But we need to figure it out how long can she last…”

By the time we returned to the hostel that evening, Janhvi’s was fighting for her life. Her steps were wobbly and baby small. Her top had ridden high on her torso and her bulge jutted out till her navel. The straps of her thong were digging into her skin but even then, she still didn’t make any mention of needing the bathroom. She rocked back and forth as she tried to complete her homework, but concentration was difficult to come by. She occasionally sipped from her trusty water bottle now perhaps into its third refill and looked at it almost with contempt.

That night, I couldn’t help but keep an ear out for any signs of movement from Janhvi’s side of the room. But, to my surprise, she didn’t get up to go out. I heard her phone buzz. Janhvi hurriedly answered. “Babe. H-how are you doing?” I quickly texted Ada & Tira. They too were listening closely.

“I need h-help.. I’m sorry I overestimated….” Janhvi whispered. “I’m not sure…”, “I need t-to train, I will follow your instructions.”, “Noooo! I would never do that..” There was a long pause.

“Can I…Please come over to pee?” And then all of a sudden we heard her thanking her boyfriend, before bolting outside the room. That was the final part of the puzzle. Everything was crystal clear in front of us. Now all we had to do was break her...

To be continued...

Hi Omo Lovers. Thank you so much for showering all your appreciation and love on this story. Here's the epic finale. You will see Janhvi's true capacity today 🤩

Final Test:

By this point, we had pieced together everything about Janhvi’s obsession with holding. It wasn’t just about holding for long periods while drinking gallons anymore; her boyfriend had taken things to the next level by telling her she wasn’t allowed to use any bathroom except his. It was clear that her boyfriend was master at holding it and Janhvi was trying to get there. That explained why she’d sneak out late at night to meet him in the adjacent boys’ hostel. The control, the competition—everything seemed tied to him. And honestly? That made it more interesting for the three of us. Ada, Tira, and I had spent weeks watching Janhvi holding her pee regularly for two days at a time. But now, with our semester tests coming up, we hatched a plan – to break Janhvi’s bladder. The opportunity was perfect. Four consecutive days of exams, followed by nights of studying, meant we’d be together almost constantly. All we had to do was not let her out of sight.

Monday was the first day of our tests. That dawn, Janhvi came to the room with a flat belly – a rare sight of late. “Babe I hate this feeling of being empty… Yeah… I know you want me to study properly but it was not necessary.”

I chuckled to myself as I overheard her. “No babe! I appreciate it that you want to let me go tomorrow as well but I will happily control myself till Wednesday. I really love to hold my pee. Pleeeeeeease!”

Oh, she was going to regret her words. “Yayyy! Thank you babe! See you on Wednesday.” She gleefully hung up the call and slid into her bed to catch up on some sleep.

At that point, we all knew there would be no action on Monday, and she would start getting fidgety from Tuesday evening onwards. So, on Monday and Tuesday, we went about our routine feasting our eyes on Janhvi chugging refill after refill of her water bottle and subtly making her drink extra beverages whenever possible. Finally, when it was Tuesday evening, we put our plan to action.

“So,” I said casually, as we settled with our books, “I am thinking we should pull an all-nighter tonight. Really cram for tomorrow’s exam.”

“An all-nighter? Isn’t that a little intense?” Janhvi raised an eyebrow, crossing her legs tightly. The first signs were there.

“Yeah, but we’ll take turns sleeping in shifts,” Ada added, jumping in smoothly. “One person can sleep while the others keep studying, and we can rotate.”

Janhvi seemed a little concerned by the idea. She nodded, “Alright, I’m in. But I might need to take a break at some point.” I exchanged a quick glance with Ada and Tira. We knew exactly what kind of “break” she was talking about, and there was no way we were letting that happen.

“Of course!” I said quickly. “We’ve stocked the room with food, water, stuff toys and anything you might need. We can’t let each other cut any slack. It’ll be fun!” Janhvi gulped down her throat, glancing down at her grotesquely bulging bladder and then at the clock to do mental math. It had been roughly 40 hours since she last peed and probably another 40 to go if our plan was successful. As hours ticked by and her bladder got fuller, Janhvi got more and more restless. She could not sit in the same position for more than a few minutes. Her hands kept dabbing off the sweat from her forehead and she kept curling and un-curling her toes. Janhvi’s eyes flickered with a brief flash of panic as the full bottle was placed in front of her, but she had no choice but to play along.

“Th-Thanks, Ada,” Janhvi stammered, her voice strained, as she took the bottle and raised it to her lips. She managed one big gulp before her body betrayed her. Her face tightened as her bladder, already screaming under the load, revolted violently at the additional liquid. Janhvi froze, the water still in her mouth, unable to swallow or spit it out, caught in a tense moment of indecision as her overfull bladder contracted in protest. She sat there, her cheeks puffed with water, for minutes at a stretch, clearly battling every instinct not to lose control.

“Are you OK Janhvi?” Tira pitched in. Janhvi hurriedly gulped down the water with a forced swallow, her whole body tensing up as she did. “Y-Yeah, fine,” she mumbled quickly, though her flushed face and movements said otherwise. Later that night, Janhvi made quite a few attempts to sneak out —saying she needed to study alone for a bit or take a quick walk—we found a way to keep her with us. “Hey, Janhvi, can you explain this concept to me?” Ada would ask, or “I really need help with this section,” Tira would chime in. It worked every time, and Janhvi—though clearly desperate —obliged. Her bladder must have been begging her to leave, but she stayed, fidgeting endlessly as she tried to focus on helping us with our fake study questions.

I could tell her bladder was starting to throw tantrums as it anticipated it’s routine pee after two days. The pressure in her bladder was clearly reaching unbearable levels. She tried to hide it, but the signs were everywhere: the way she kept standing up to pace around the room, the constant shifting in her seat, the small huffs of breath she took whenever she thought we weren’t paying attention. She was totally distracted from studying now, her eyes glazed over with the effort of holding back what had to be gallons of pee. But still, she said nothing about it. Not to us, anyway. As dawn approached, I overheard her talking quietly to her boyfriend on the phone, her voice barely a whisper but filled with tension.

“Yeah… still holding it,” she whispered, her voice tense but determined. “No, I haven’t had a chance to leave… They are all awake...” There was a pause, and then she added, “Gah! I’ve had so much to drink but I think I will have to wait until tomorrow….” Her boyfriend must’ve suggested using the attached bathroom right there in the room, but Janhvi quickly shut that idea down. “Nooo babe! I promised you,” she hissed, trying to keep her voice low so we wouldn’t hear. “I’ll only use your bathroom… I can hold it… I swear… I’m under control…”

I couldn’t help but smirk to myself as I lay in bed. “Tomorrow?” That would mean more than 48 hours of holding it. And if everything went according to plan, she wouldn’t get any chance to relieve herself tomorrow, either.

On the third day of tests, Janhvi went to the exams with 54 hours of pee sloshing inside her. During the exam that day, I sat next to her. She was biting her lip, her legs crossed tightly under the desk, and she kept fidgeting with her pen. Sweat dripped on her paper and her ragged breath could be heard throughout the exam hall. Even the invigilator asked her if she was OK. When she finished her test, she waited till the entire class got vacated. I, Ada & Tira watched her from outside. She laid her head on the table and shrieked out in frustration, yelling at her bladder. “JUST HOLD IT GODDAMN!”.

That afternoon, we regrouped to study again, and Janhvi was frantic. She was trying so hard to maintain her usual air of calm, but her bladder was clearly taking over, and her body wasn’t cooperating anymore. Every now and then, I’d catch her squeezing and kneading her crotch.

“You okay, Janhvi? Do you need to use the bathroom?” I asked innocently, pretending not to notice her discomfort.

“N-no! Never!,” she said, her voice tight. “Why would I need to go to the bathroom… I can m-manage!” We all exchanged subtle glances, knowing full well it wasn’t really MANAGEABLE for her. By the time night rolled, she’d stopped drinking as much water. Tira took it on herself to change that and asked Janhvi that she barely had any water today. “Janhvi you must not cut down on water. It causes headaches you know…” Janhvi’s lips quivered as she reached for her water bottle, her hand trembling as she lifted it. She brought it to her mouth slowly, each movement careful, as if she feared one wrong move would cause her to lose control completely. She took a few mouthfuls, swallowing slowly, her body tense with the effort of keeping it all inside. Her bladder was visibly swollen beneath her taut skin, and while her underwear was still dry, the sight of her bloated abdomen told the full story—her bladder had been corked up for more than two days, and she was nearing her breaking point.

Dinner came and went, and somehow, we managed to keep her drinking. With a bit of nudging and a lot of subtle manipulation, we got her to finish her second refill of the day. By now, Janhvi was almost unrecognizable. The confident, perfect diva of the college had been reduced to a desperate school-girl on the verge of bursting. She was frantic now and her body shook violently. Her body was shaking, her skin shining with sweat, and goosebumps covered her arms and legs. She no longer cared for dignity and tightly grabbed herself. Even when we coaxed her into admitting if she needed to pee, she vehemently refused. “I’m just anxious about tomorrow’s tests.”

Later that night, I noticed Janhvi sneaking off to the corner, her phone pressed tightly against her ear. Her face was pale, her eyes squinted, and she kept shifting her weight from foot to foot, her legs clenched together as she whispered into the phone.

“I’m so frustrated, babe… I’m starting to…” Her voice was barely audible, strained and full of tension. “They’re suspecting that I need to pee… I’m just so full…”

There was a long pause, and I strained to hear her boyfriend’s reply, though his words were muffled. Whatever he said seemed to calm her down a little, but not enough to ease her situation.

“Thank you babe…I finally held it for three full days..” she whispered after a few moments. “But I won’t pee here. I’ll wait until tomorrow. I’ll… try to enjoy this extra day of hold..”

I could hardly believe what I was hearing. Janhvi’s boyfriend had GIVEN HER PERMISSION to relieve herself, to finally let go after three excruciating days of holding it in. And yet, she was still refusing. As she hung up the phone, she waddled back to her bed. Her hand remained glued to her crotch and her fingers kept twitching and rubbing her labia as a distraction.

The morning of the final test—day four—Janhvi was a wreck. There was no other way to describe it. Her movements were as if she was tied with an invisible rope. Her face was pale, except for her burning red cheeks. The weight of her bladder, swollen beyond anything I had ever seen. Her skin was stretched so tightly that she couldn’t stand straight without wincing. Her belly bulged out so as far as her navel. The fabric of her miniskirt was on the verge of giving up. Fortunately, she put an oversized top that day otherwise people would think she were pregnant. From that moment I knew she was going to break today. Her face was drenched in sweat, and her body shook with every step she took. Her legs were shivered, thighs pressing together as if she was physically fighting to keep the flood from escaping. From time to time, her hand would fly towards her crotch, but she would just stop short. How she kept her hands away from her pussy was unfathomable for me.

“Janhvi, are you okay?” I asked, though the answer was obvious.

“I’m f-fine,” she snapped, her voice tight and breathless. She couldn’t even get the words out without pausing to catch her breath. Even her eyelids were covered with sweat. “Let’s j-just get this test over with.”

She walked into the exam hall slowly, but I noticed that every few steps, she had to stop, her legs buckling slightly beneath her. Twice, she squatted down midway, her hands gripping the edge of a desk as she tried to stay upright. It was clear she was on the verge of losing it. Her bladder must have been sloshing violently with every movement, screaming for release, but Janhvi—determined & stubborn – somehow managed to stem any spurts. During the test, I couldn’t take my eyes off Janhvi. Her legs crossed and uncrossed constantly beneath the desk.

Every few seconds, she shifted in her seat, but it was clear that even moving an inch was excruciating. Her hands clutched the edges of her chair so tightly that her knuckles had turned white, and the way she gripped the wood made it look like she was physically trying to anchor herself down, to stop her body from gushing like a hose. The faint creaking of her skirt was unmistakable. It was stretched to the point of tearing, the seams visibly straining against the pressure. I could see the waistband digging cruelly into her swollen belly, cutting into her skin, but she didn’t dare loosen it. She couldn’t afford even a slight loss of control—any tiny shift might mean the end.

Beads of sweat rolled down her temples, gathering on her neck before soaking into the collar of her top. She was sweating profusely, and not just from the heat of the exam room—it was the intense, maddening effort of holding back what must have been an ocean inside her. Janhvi’s breathing was shallow, uneven, like she couldn’t get enough air. Every few minutes, her jaw would clench tightly, and groan in desperation. I could see the muscles in her neck tense as she fought back the urge to cry out in frustration and agony. She was BURSTING —and it showed. Her bladder had to be screaming at her, the sheer size of it pushing against her waistband so forcefully that I couldn’t believe it hadn’t already given way. It was almost painful to watch.

Her eyes flicked to the clock over and over again. I knew it wasn’t the test she was worried about—she wasn’t even focused on it anymore. It was her bladder, the insane pressure inside her that was becoming impossible to contain. As the minutes ticked by, I saw her hand dart under the desk, her nails digging into her thighs. She was trying so hard to be subtle, but the way her body trembled gave her away. She was fighting an impossible battle.

I leaned closer, whispering under my breath, “Janhvi, YOU NEED TO PEE – JUST GO!”

Her eyes shot toward me, wild with desperation, and she shook her head slightly. Her voice, when it came out, was tight, barely more than a choked whisper. “N-no. I can h-hold it.”

But she shifted again, this time more frantically, and I could hear the fabric of her skirt creak again, louder this time, as if it was moments away from ripping at the seams. Her thighs pressed together so tightly, I thought she might bruise herself, and her hands—both of them now—were clasping her crotch, in a last-ditch. Her whole body was violently shaking. Sweat dripped from her chin onto the paper, and her breathing had become quick, shallow gasps.

She wasn’t even pretending to take the test anymore—her eyes were squeezed shut, her jaw clenched tight, and all of her concentration was focused on one thing: not letting go. Her legs were bouncing rapidly, her fingers digging into her thighs as she fought with every ounce of willpower to keep the flood at bay. Her swollen bladder was so distended now that it was practically deforming her silhouette, the fabric of her skirt bowing outward - even filling her oversized top. Another minute passed, and she shifted again, letting out a faint whimper as her knees buckled beneath the desk. Her lips parted, but no words came out—just a sharp, desperate exhale, like she was moments away from breaking down completely.

I leaned in again, whispering as quietly as I could. “Janhvi, you’re not going to make it..”

Her head jerked toward me; her eyes filled with panic. She opened her mouth to speak but no words came out—only a shallow, shaky breath. Then, finally, in a voice so small it was barely a whisper, she muttered, “I... I don’t need to pee.. No matter what…” Her pride was still fuelling her control, but her clock was ticking down. By the time the test was over, Janhvi looked completely broken. She was restless, barely able to stand up straight without squatting down halfway, her hands constantly pressed between her thighs as she tried to keep herself together.

Her top clung to her sweaty body. Her skirt – now ridden halfway up her glutes - seemed like it would rip at any moment. She steeled herself to wait for the whole classroom to vacate before she pulled herself up. Even the basic task of keeping her legs still was impossible to do without taking support of the desks. Once out, her eyes fell on the distant ladies room as if finally contemplating to give up but we sadists didn’t let her escape. As soon as the test ended, Tira—who had been waiting for this moment—jumped in with her plan.

“We’re going out tonight!” Tira announced cheerfully, her voice full of excitement.

Ada and I immediately chimed in, backing her up. “Definitely. We deserve to celebrate after surviving all that studying!”

Janhvi blinked at us, her eyes wide with a mix of shock and fear. Her hands were still gripping the hem of her skirt, her legs crossed so tightly that her knees trembled. She looked like she was on the verge of collapse.

"N-not... tonight please. I beg" she stammered, her voice strained and breathless. Her desperation was so obvious, it was almost painful to watch. Every word seemed to take effort, like speaking was the last thing she could manage right now with her bladder threatening to explode.

“Janhvi…We can all tell that you are DYING to pee. Either you GO now or else you are coming with us.” Tira snapped at her.

Janhvi hesitated, her eyes longingly looked at the ladies room again, clearly wanting to give up the mammoth load. “Let me make a c-call first.” She stepped aside.

I, Ada & Tira pretended like we couldn’t hear but the whole conversation was easily audible.

“Babe…I…” She gasped. “Need to pee…please…can I go?”

“I asked you to GO earlier in YOUR bathroom, but you refused…I’m sorry but you need to hold it like you promised.”

“Babe…Please..Only this time…They want to go partying.. There will be too much to drink…” Janhvi’s words ended in a whisper.

“Then you drink AND hold it. And behave yourself when out,” her boyfriend remained adamant.

She nodded and straightened herself, biting her lips and groaning. She had no way out. Finally, with a forced, tight-lipped smile, she nodded. “Alright… fine. Let’s go out.”

Back in the room, things got worse for Janhvi. We all picked up clothes for ourselves while she remained seated with her hand still glued to her crotch.

"You know what you should wear tonight?" Ada said, a mischievous glint in her eyes. "That denim mini dress of yours. It just hugs your body perfectly."

Janhvi froze, her face turning even paler. “Ada not that one,” she mumbled, her voice shaky. “I’m not feeling up to it…”

“Nonsense!” Tira exclaimed, practically pushing her toward the closet. “You HAVE to wear it! Boys will drool over it.”

She knew wearing that tight dress would be torture on her already bulging bladder, but she had no way to refuse without giving herself away. Finally, after a long pause, Ada herself pulled out the denim number from her wardrobe and we made Janhvi wear it. As expected the dress wouldn’t go beyond her belly. Ada winked at me, “Janhvi, please suck your belly.” She could barely part her legs let alone suck her bulge in. “I c-can’t.” Ada jumped on it. “Shruti please help me.” I placed my hand on her bulge for the FIRST TIME! It was radiating heat. Her eyes widened in fear. Before she could stop me, I pressed her bulge with all my might. She yelped in pain, as her bladder refused to go in. It was like I was trying to squeeze in a fish-bowl sloshing with water. I kept on applying pressure. Her legs wobbled and Ada pulled the dress up with one sharp tug.

It didn’t take long to see how bad of an idea the dress was. The moment we zipped her into it, the dress squeezed every curve of her body, especially her abdomen, which jutted out from her petite frame. Even the denim failed to flatten it such was the pressure building inside her bladder. She was panting and shuddering as she staring at herself with wide, anxious eyes, her body visibly trembling under the strain.

“I… I don’t think I can wear this,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “It’s too tight.”

But Tira and Ada weren’t having it. “Nonsense, you look incredible!” Ada said, smiling widely. “You’ve gotta wear it, Janhvi.”

Janhvi looked like she was about to argue, but her body tensed up as another spasm hit her. She swallowed hard and forced another smile as we stepped out.

The night was pure agony for her. From the moment we stepped out of the hostel, we had to hold Janhvi’s hands to help her walk. She took each step carefully measured. “These heels are not easy,” was her excuse. The tight dress seemed to push deeper into her swollen belly, making her wince in pain. Her hands tightly clutched the hem of that dress and not because it was super short but to somehow ease herself. Her body was drenched in sweat within minutes of walking.

As we reached the first bar, Janhvi was already starting to lose control. As soon as she saw an empty couch she plopped herself onto it, immediately crossing her legs.

“You okay, Janhvi?” I asked innocently, pretending not to notice her obvious desperation.

“Y-yeah,” she stammered, her voice shaky. “Just… just fine.”

But it was clear she was anything but fine. Her face was turning redder by the minute. Soon came the drinks and we saw panic flash on her face. Janhvi’s lips trembled, her eyes darting nervously between the bottle and her massive, bulging bladder. “N-no thanks… I’m good.” But we girls were hell bent on breaking her. We simply didn’t pay heed to her requests and soon she had finished quite a few pints of beer. By the time we got to the final bar, Janhvi was a mess. Her body was visibly shivering with effort, her muscles tensing up with every tiny movement. and she could hardly walk more than a few feet without squatting down halfway. It was truly baffling how she hadn’t wet herself.

“I… I need to… I can’t…” she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath.

“You’ll be fine,” Tira said with a grin, though we could all see that Janhvi was on the verge of losing it.

Her words were rushed, her breathing erratic. She couldn’t speak more than a few words at a time without stopping to focus on holding back the flood that was threatening to burst through at any second. She had stopped drinking entirely by now, though Ada kept offering her water just to see how much further we could push her. But still, Janhvi refused to admit defeat. She was shaking from head to toe, but she wouldn’t give in. Not yet.

By the time we finally made it back to the hostel, it was sharp 4AM, and Janhvi was at her absolute breaking point. Her steps were jerky and uneven. Every few feet, she would squat down, her whole-body trembling as she fought to maintain control. Her face was drenched in sweat, her hair sticking to her skin, and her breathing was shallow and fast, as if she was moments away from breaking down entirely. As we climbed the stairs to our room, I could see the tears welling up in her eyes. Her hands were pressed tightly between her legs now, no longer caring about appearances. Her entire body was screaming for relief, her muscles so tense they looked like they might snap.

Finally, as we reached the room, Janhvi froze. Her face turned a deep red, her legs squirming beneath her as she let out a sharp, panicked gasp. Her hands flew to her crotch, grabbing it with all her might. But it was too late. We saw the moment she lost the battle—her body shook violently, and her eyes went wide with a mix of horror and disbelief. Her mouth gaped open but not a word came out. Her nostrils flared and the veins on her forehead stiffened up. The distinct sound of seams ripping apart echoed through the room just like her sharp exhale.

A spurt gushed out through her fingers. “No… no, no, no…” she whispered, her voice barely audible. She tightened her grip and another spurt escaped and then as she tried to cross her legs her muscles could no longer bear the torturous tsunami brewing inside for the past FOUR DAYS. A huge stream of pee started gurgling from her crotch from all directions and crevices of her palms. She still tried to fight the flow, but the force was simply uncontainable. It kept splattering and running down her bare legs forming a puddle beneath her legs.

Finally, Janhvi gave up and removed her hand. All the pee cupped between her hand kept crashing down the floor making a huge splash. She bent forward, keeping her hands on her thighs for support as her bladder contracted. We saw her bulge heave up and down akin to heartbeat and her stream kept gushing out similarly – high and low – high and low. Had it not been for our own eyes we would never believe that a girl as petite as Janhvi could pee with such a strong force. Her stream was as thick as y wrist.

Ada nudged me to look at the clock. It was 4.04AM and yet Janhvi showed no signs of slowing down. Around the 5th minute when her stream slowed down we thought she was finally emptying herself. We all got up from the couch to help her but then she looked at us, mouthing “There’s more” and suddenly another equally strong torrent erupted from her crotch. The puddle had destroyed the floor, our heels, and anything that was on the floor. When the stream came to an abrupt stop, Janhvi smiled to us and collapsed on the floor, passing out with a smile on her face.

I, Ada and Tira called her boyfriend into our room. He came in at once and was astonished to look at the destruction left by Janhvi. He just smiled at us and carried Janhvi in his arms to his room. All he said was, “She’s truly a bladder queen. Thank you for helping her achieve her goal.”
