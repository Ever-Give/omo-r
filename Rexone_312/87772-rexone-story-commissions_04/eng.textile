Prospera Under Pressure

Early Start to the Day

Prospera's day usually began with an obnoxiously loud alarm clock. Today however, she didn’t have to rely on her alarm. Her bladder was gurgling with a huge load of pee, and it woke her up well before the alarm. She dragged herself out of her cozy bed and bolted to the bathroom. Half-way in the process of taking down the pyjamas and landing her butt on the porcelain bowl, it gushed out like a waterfall. The extra litre of water she drank before bed, came out which a brute force splashing the water from the WC on her bubble butt. “Phew! I needed that!”, she muttered to herself as the torrent went on for nearly a minute.

After squeezing out the last possible drop from her bladder and a quick shower, she made herself a hearty breakfast. A bowl of creamy yogurt adorned with a rainbow of fruits graced her breakfast table. It was coupled with a tall glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a steaming cup of herbal tea. She believed in the power of liquids to maintain peak health, and today was no exception. With breakfast devoured, Prospera opened her trusty calendar. There were two activities lined up for the day – each highlighted with red - the first one was a secret experiment at her facility and later, a prestigious science conference. Her heart raced with excitement as she anticipated the day's challenges.

Determined to maintain her powerful image, she went to her wardrobe and pulled out her usual grey business casual suit. To the unversed, it was the same black shirt coupled with her high waisted grey trousers and a blazer. She got it recently tailored to perfection, designed to hug her body, and offer a wrinkle-free, snug fit. However, as she wriggled into the sleek attire, it quickly became apparent that snug was an understatement. The suit was a vice, squeezing her like a tube of toothpaste.

She tugged at the fabric of her trousers and performed all sorts of gymnastics to wiggle into it. Half-way into the trousers, she was lying on the ground contorted and perspiring. She could simply go back to her wardrobe and opt for a looser outfit, but she decided the opposite. After a long struggle with the apparel, the mirror reflected back the undeniable truth—it looked just the way she wanted it to. She put on her grey futuristic helmet and bam! Embracing the tightness, she ventured forth into her bustling day.

The Unexpected Glitch Soon after Prospera reached her facility. The pre-dawn hours cast long shadows over Prospera's high-security facility. She strode through the dimly lit corridors, the only soul stirring in the silence. Each step echoed in the emptiness around her. The facility, typically bustling with researchers and assistants, lay dormant. She went to great lengths to keep the experiment hidden under the wraps. After the Vanadis incident, Prospera sought revenge from Delling Rembran and the Benerit group, who were the main culprits behind the attacks. Under the pretext of Shin Sei Development Corporation, she was conducting her own development to build a new type of Gundam mobile suit equipped with Artificial Intelligence system. It was imperative that no one else knew about it.

As she navigated the labyrinth of hallways, her lower belly sloshed with a reminder of the liquid-heavy breakfast she had indulged in earlier. Her constrictive attire, chosen for the sake of professionalism, was already causing her discomfort. The call of nature was manageable but surely undeniable. She quickened her pace, heading for the facility's solitary bathroom. The flickering fluorescent light revealed a locked door. The janitor, holder of the key, was not scheduled to arrive for another three hours. She let out an exasperated sigh and leaned against the bathroom door, her hands pressed against it as if attempting to will it open. Her mind raced, considering alternatives, but she didn’t want to contaminate the pristine environment. With a resigned shrug, she straightened herself. “I should start keeping spare keys with me”, she made a mental note to herself, “but for now, I must hold it in like a professional. Mission comes first.”

Inwardly cursing the timing of her morning hydration, she pressed on. The lab awaited, and her determination was unshaken, even if her bladder was not. The day had just begun, and Prospera was already juggling secrecy, science, and a steadily growing need for a restroom that felt light-years away. In the pristine confines of her lab, she began the experiment, a cutting-edge AI-based targeting system. The room hummed with the soft whirr of machines, and the monitors blinked with anticipation. She had meticulously planned this experiment and the initial tests went by like a dream. Data flowed smoothly, and she couldn't help but smile with satisfaction. Her fingers danced across the control panel, adjusting parameters with the grace of a conductor directing an orchestra.

However, as the morning sun painted the sky in hues of orange and gold, only the final test was remaining. She fed the parameters into the system and executed it. As the initiation began, the facility monitoring system showed that the bathroom door was now unlocked, and the janitor had gone to the farthermost wing for cleaning. It was the most enticing opportunity for her to relieve herself. She gently got up from the chair as her bladder sent strong signals, suggesting that it was happy with her decision. However, just as she approached the door, all the monitors inside the room flooded with red patches of “Critical Error” messages.

“NOOOO!” She almost yelled. The most critical simulation revealed a devastating glitch. Her brow furrowed, and her smile vanished. Any chance of relieving herself was thrown out of the window. Her bladder sent a few pangs down there, but she sat into her chair, immediately crossing her legs tightly. The data on the screen looked like a Jackson Pollock painting gone wrong, a chaotic mess of lines and numbers.

She didn’t even notice that she had started to breathe sharply through her mouth. Her bladder remained persistent like an itch. The rising pressure, which had been a background annoyance, now escalated to the forefront of her mind. She must have been at a scale of 5/10 and on any normal day she would have relieved herself by now. But things were different today. It was as if her own bladder had joined the rebellion against her experiment. Her confident body language began to falter. Her legs shifted restlessly, swaying like reeds in the wind. She crossed and uncrossed her arms, trying to find a comfortable stance that seemed increasingly elusive. Her jaw clenched as she suppressed the urge to squirm outright. Amidst all this, she struggled to concentrate on the malfunctioning system and simultaneously tighten her muscles to stem the dire need to pee. Each sip of water from her bottle, once mindless and necessary to stay hydrated in the warm chamber, now felt like a cruel joke.

The AI system, oblivious to her bodily needs, continued to defy her. With each passing moment, the glitch appeared more stubborn, more resistant to her attempts at correction. Only her sheer willpower kept her going. She had a mission to complete, and even her body's crying demands couldn't deter her. She pressed on, battling not only technological glitches but her evil bladder as well. It seemed that on this eventful morning, she was not only testing the limits of her scientific skills but the boundaries of her own endurance.

Retry & Delay Frustration hung in the lab like a heavy fog, clinging to Prospera's every move. Five relentless hours had ticked away since her last bathroom break. And with each hour more and more liquid flowed into her constrained bladder. “Why the hell am I getting so desperate today?” In the middle of all the tension, it never occurred to her that the tight fabric of her new high waisted trousers left no room for the bladder to expand. She blew air out of her mouth and dabbed her sweat away. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, a frantic dance of desperation, as she attempted to placate the insistent computer. Her seat, once a bastion of calm, had become a torture chamber. It did not allow her to slouch forward for the slightest comfort. She fanned her legs incessantly to silence her bladder which was getting pumped by the second.

With her bladder at a scale of 6/10 now, her eyes darted from one error message to another, her lips moving silently as if offering muttered apologies to the malfunctioning screens. Each red-lettered message taunted her, pushing her further toward the brink of exasperation. Every keystroke was a desperate plea for mercy from the obstinate technology. “Please work! Please work!” She shifted in her seat and tapped her foot impatiently. Her lips trembled as she read through the laundry list of errors. Her concentration was faltering, yet she wouldn’t give up the high stakes battle between her mind and body. Her teeth gritting in silent resolve, she vowed to conquer the obstinate technology before yielding to the bubbling pressure within her.

Six hours passed by since her last trip to the bathroom and 1.5 litres of liquid sloshed in her belly. Yet Prospera made no move to relieve herself. Her eyeballs moved rapidly across the screens as she corrected the logic of the program. Much like her pace, even the pee inside her bladder pushed towards her pee hole as if forming an army, ready to strike an attack. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, she managed to coax the stubborn computer into submission. The glitch that haunted her morning was vanquished. “Victory!” Her happiness overcame her, and without a second thought, she jumped up with an exuberant cheer. But jubilation turned to instant regret. The joyous leap, normally an innocent celebration, had triggered a new battle cry from within—a battle cry issued by her aching bladder. A ripple of desperation travelled from her angry bladder throughout her limbs. Her face contorted in a blend of panic and agony as the urgency struck her like a lightning bolt.

Prospera gasped for air and tried to tug away the waist band of her trousers, but it was futile. She took a step toward the lab's exit, her eyes fixated on the bathroom door, just a few agonizingly long strides away. Her entire being pleaded at her to make the run of her life. However, her eyes flicked to the clock hanging on the wall. The hands pointed accusingly at the hour, declaring her lateness to the world. Panic surged within her like a tidal wave, drowning out every other sensation. She was late—terribly late—and she knew what awaited her outside the sanctuary of her lab. The entire facility would be buzzing with activity. Colleagues, scientists, and nosy interns would all have arrived, punctual as the morning sun. And Prospera would not want anyone to know what she had been doing since dawn. She wasn't ready to reveal to the world just yet even if it meant enduring the pain for much longer.

Her heart raced, and she clamped her hand over her mouth to stifle a frustrated scream. Time was not on her side, but neither was her bursting bladder. With a final, agonized look at the tantalizing bathroom door, she turned on her heel and headed to the back of the lab, where a hidden door concealed her escape route. It was a secret passage that led away from the prying eyes of her colleagues and the danger of exposing her confidential project. With a deep breath and every ounce of willpower she possessed, she pushed open the hidden door and slipped out into the labyrinthine passages of the lab's secret network, leaving behind the source of her frustration and the ultimate race against time.

Stuck in Traffic – Last moment arrival Seven agonizing hours had ticked by since Prospera's last chance to use the bathroom. She had consumed enough liquid for a small army, a choice she now deeply regretted. She dearly regretted wearing her newly tailored grey suit, which kept getting tighter somehow. It didn’t help her as she sat in her car, stuck in a snail-paced traffic jam. Sometimes she would look out of the window and sometimes she would switch on her advanced portable computer to run some calculations. But nothing could take her mind away from the pressure. She squirmed in her seat, her legs twitching with discomfort, as if they had developed a life of their own, dancing to the rhythm of her urgency. The steering wheel was the only support to hang on to.

Thankfully no one could see her full face which was contorted underneath the mask. It completely concealed the chaos within. As the traffic started to move, polite nods were exchanged with fellow commuters, each nod an internal scream of impatience. In her mind, she shouted, "Move it, people!" Yet, all that escaped her lips were forced pleasantries, her voice strained and high-pitched, betraying the turbulence beneath her calm exterior.

Another painfully long hour dragged on before Prospera's car inched closer to the conference venue's parking lot. Her knuckles were white against the steering wheel, her foot tapping an erratic rhythm of impatience. The radio played cheerful tunes, oblivious to her mounting desperation. Despite her constrictive trousers, her bladder bulged enough to be noticed by the onlookers. The pressure was reaching critical stages now – A solid 7.5/10. “I can hold it . . .I can hold it”, she kept whispering to herself. Finally, the moment arrived when Prospera finally parked her car. Faster than a bullet, she flung the door open and rushed to the entrance. Her hips swayed widely. Her bladder had grown to such proportions inside that her gait inadvertently changed to accommodate the load. Though no one could tell if she needed to pee. But beneath the façade of poise, she was locked in an epic battle of self-control, the intensity etched into her features.

Stepping into the conference hall was like entering an ice-cold waterfall, a cruel contrast to her overheated desperation. The air conditioning was so potent, it clung to her like a frosty shroud. Her body shuddered and the pressure shot up manifold. Prospera's continued walking towards the reception, each step marked by a discreet clenching of her muscles.

Conference – Presentation of Unique Inventions Prospera was about to ask the receptionist about the bathrooms just when her daughter Suletta, with her bright eyes and youthful energy, came rushing toward her. Prospera's face was flushed, and a bead of sweat dripping from her cheeks. Her discomfort was evident, but she fought to maintain her composure.

Suletta gazed at her mother, her voice carrying an anxious undertone. "Mom, are you okay? You look a bit... flustered."

Prospera managed a tight smile, her voice tinged with a forced casualness. "Oh, sweetheart, I'm perfectly fine. Has the program begun, or do we have a few minutes?” She tried to brush off her daughter's concern, not wanting her to see the vulnerability beneath the surface. Suletta raised an eyebrow, her intuition sharpened by years of observing her mother's quirks. "Mom, please tell me you don’t need to pee. . . You are late already."

Prospera chuckled nervously, shifting her weight from foot to foot as she tried to downplay her discomfort. "No, no, I'm good. It's just... anticipation. I want to enjoy the conference without any unnecessary breaks." As she spoke, her words betrayed her frantic desperation to hold it together. She glanced around, avoiding eye contact with her daughter, but the truth was that she was battling a biological clock that refused to synchronise with her schedule.

Once inside, Prospera's willpower was as fierce as ever. To her it was important to always look like the woman who was always in control, to her daughter - even if it meant holding onto the edge of her seat, quite literally. Soon the conference commenced. In fact, it dragged on, seemingly oblivious to Prospera's internal turmoil. She found herself trapped in a never-ending loop of discomfort, caught between the bone-chilling air conditioning and a constant supply of coffee. She reluctantly sipped from her cup, the warmth providing a fleeting comfort from the frigid room, but each sip only exacerbated the pressure within her.

As the presenters showcased their unique inventions, Prospera struggled to maintain her focus. With Suletta seating next to her she could not even squirm or shift in her seat, which she desperately wanted. She tried her best to stay calm, but truth be told she could feel her heart beating like a drum. Her once-poised posture now resembled a seesaw in distress. Her legs, once crossed demurely, had started to engage in an intricate dance of their own, crossing and uncrossing in a futile attempt to find comfort. Her body gently rocked back and forth, a subtle yet frantic movement she couldn't control. The unforgiving waistband of her tight pants dug mercilessly into her bulging bladder, adding an added layer of discomfort to an already unbearable situation.

Prospera endured the onslaught of presentations and innovations. Her mind was engrossed in something else entirely. She gritted her teeth while mentally calculating the amount of liquid she consumed. “9 hours! I cannot believe that I have held it for so long. But I must control, I cannot be seen like this.” She was stubborn to not to be the first to give in, even if it meant keeping her sweaty ass planted to the chair. As the session continued, Prospera's thoughts oscillated between the ingenious inventions on display and the incessant throb in her bladder. She couldn't help but wonder if any of these innovations could solve her current predicament.

Sudden Invitation to speak on Stage Another begrudgingly slow hour later, the session finally ended, Prospera felt a sense of urgency she hadn't anticipated. Ten hours without a bathroom break, and her body was on the brink of revolt. She eyed the bathroom door down the hall, her heart racing faster than a rocket launch. “Daughter, I need to make a call really quick – I will be just back.” But just as she began her dash for relief, a voice over the speakers stopped her dead in her tracks.

"Ladies and gentlemen," the host declared, "we have a surprise guest joining us on stage today!" She froze, her worst nightmare unfolding before her very eyes. Suletta cheered her to go to the stage and attend that call later. The audience erupted in applause, and Prospera, once again, had to defy the laws of biology. She found herself hobbling toward the stage. With every step, the pressure inside her intensified. She could feel steam emanating from her ears as the host asked her opinion on the inventions showcased earlier.

Her body trembled. Her lips were pursed, as if mimicking her lips down there which battled the gusher of pee throbbing to explode in her tight pants. She strained to recall the inventions she'd seen earlier, her thoughts as jumbled as a tangled mess of wires. Her sweaty hands grasped the podium, desperately seeking stability, but her bladder was merciless. She opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out. The audience looked at her with anticipation oblivious to her predicament. The dam of hot boiling pee inside her threatened to unleash a catastrophic flood of embarrassment.

Nervous lines of strain formed on her forehead; her palms clammy as she struggled to maintain her composure. Prospera's eyes darted around the stage, seeking any possible escape from the impending catastrophe. She forced an uneasy smile, beads of perspiration trickling down her temples. Pretending as if something was wrong with the microphone, she reached for it with shaky fingers, fumbling with the controls in a frantic attempt to appear calm. Her voice quivered as she muttered apologetic half-sentences, "Just a... technical glitch... give me a moment..."

But underneath the veneer of professionalism, she was locked in a losing battle with her own body. Her bladder, stretched to its absolute limit, screamed for release, and she discreetly clutched her crotch behind the lectern, a futile effort to stave off the impending disaster. Time seemed to stretch into an agonizing eternity as Prospera fiddled with the microphone, the seconds ticking away like the countdown to a catastrophe. She was functioning purely on adrenaline now, her thoughts a chaotic whirlwind of urgency and panic. She could hear a ringing sound in her ears as if something exploded in close proximity. But then she took one deep breath and re-attempted to speak. Her sentences, when they finally emerged, were fragmented, disjointed, like a malfunctioning robot trying to communicate. She struggled to string together coherent thoughts, her mind fragmented by the excruciating pressure building within her.

The audience, unaware of the epic internal battle unfolding before them, watched with a mix of curiosity and mild confusion. To them, Prospera's hesitation was a mere hiccup in an otherwise polished presentation. Little did they know that she was at the tip of a disaster, desperately clinging to her last shreds of dignity as she grappled with the most primal of human needs. Prospera's struggle wasn't one of nerves, but a heroic attempt to hold back the litres of liquid threatening to burst forth. Seconds turned into minutes. Every time she tried to end the on-stage conversation the host would present her with yet another stupid question. After a while even the audience started throwing questions at her.

“I wish I could kill them all with my new targeting technology!” She cursed them as she tightly gripped the edges of the lectern. She was literally hanging by it. Her legs remained twisted like a pretzel. Her calf muscles were on fire and toes felt as if someone dropped a hammer on them. The suspense hung in the air like a fog, and the audience watched in fascination as Prospera's body language told the story of a woman on the edge. All she yearned for was that one elusive word - "Thank you." After an hour, the on-stage fiasco finally concluded. The audience's applause seemed deafening, and all she could think about was reaching the finish line – the bathroom door.

Lunch & Networking Prospera's bladder was obscenely bulging now, and she was splitting at the seams. Ten gruelling hours had passed, and nearly two litres of liquid were ferociously pumped by her kidneys into her severely squeezed bladder. Her waddle resembling that of a pregnant woman desperately trying to run for the hospital. Her body arched forward, the weight of her bladder pressing her down on her sphincter like an elephant crushing a coconut. “I bet even pressure cookers have less pressure to deal with.” She cursed under her strained breathing.

As she descended from the stage, Prospera was greeted by dignitaries from the audience, all eager to make small talk and express their admiration for her unique thinking and futuristic vision. Their voices were distant echoes suppressed by screams of her bladder's protest. She fought to maintain politeness; her voice wrenched as she engaged in conversations she could hardly concentrate on. Prospera, a woman of scientific brilliance, was now reduced to a desperate charade of calm and composure. The corners of her mouth twitching with every forced smile. She clenched her fists at her sides, her knuckles turning white, as if physically restraining the outburst. The crowd further pressed in around her, showering well-intentioned greetings and compliments. She nodded and smiled, her eyes darting around hastily, searching for any sign of an escape.

The frustrating assault of pee waves on the walls of her bladder, was cracking her facade. Every polite word she uttered felt like a stab in her bladder which was now at 9.8/10. Her mind raced, counting down the seconds until she could escape the suffocating crowd and make a mad dash for the restroom. Her body was filled with cold sweat and goosebumps – a strange combination. She breathed through her mouth and curtseyed more often than she would have liked. She kept her hands clasped together as if she was mentally directing her energy to her sphincters to bear the ungodly volume for a little longer.

Just when Prospera finally pushed through the crowd a familiar figure rushed toward her. It was Suletta, her daughter, offering a tight, unsuspecting hug, squeezing her overworked bladder with a loving embrace. Prospera's bladder nearly exploded with the sudden force of the hug. An excuse about an important phone call from before, lingered on the tip of her tongue, but Suletta had other plans. She insisted Prospera to meet Miorine Rembran. At once, Prospera’s heart filled with thoughts of revenge as she saw Miorine approach her, with a polite smile on her face. Prospera was trapped, her body a battleground of willpower against her own physiology and her burning desire of revenge.

Desperation etched every line on her face as she strained to maintain composure, her voice shaking as she greeted Miorine, "I am Suletta’s mother, Prospera Mercury. Nice to meet you again!”

“Have you met before mother?” Suletta interrupted Prospera.

“Suletta – your mother is thirsty; can you get her something to drink?” Prospera sternly asked Suletta as if asking her to stop talking. Being the always obedient daughter, she at once went to fetch a drink leaving the other two alone.

“I want to know about your father Miorine?” Prospera tried to instigate Miorine despite her bladder trying to push out the first few drops in her underwear.

Miorine nodded politely, "Is this really the place to ask?”

That was indeed not the right place to ask. The drops were squeezing out past her iron like control. The pressure inside her had grown into an agonizing crescendo and yet she tried to smile through the torment. Prospera took a seat nearby clutching her bladder. An intense wave of pain hit her hard making her weak at knees. It was now a battle of her bladder and her burning desire of revenge battling her in her mind.

Despite multiple attempts, Miorine declined her request and remained resolute. That unexpected refusal from Miorine triggered panic. A jet of warm piss shot into her tight pants, nearly forming a small spot. She looked down at it and her thoughts became a jumbled mess of desperation. She could see the restroom door beckoning to her like a siren's call. Her prideful ego wanted to go on and destroy Miorine’s pride, but her bladder had enough of her. It pushed yet another jet into her pants. It was a moment of sheer horror; she felt her control slipping away like grains of sand through closed fists. Her breath hitched, and her words trailed off into an awkward silence as her mind screamed for mercy.

Seeing no progress, Prospera abandoned the conversation, a disjointed sentence hanging in the air. Panic coursed through her veins as she stumbled toward the bathroom, her steps unsteady, her heart pounding, her entire being consumed by the impending catastrophe. Her dignity was a distant memory now, and all that remained was the primal need for relief. Suletta, sensing her mother's discomfort from afar, followed her.

Outburst Prospera's had seconds to act. It was a frantic race against time. She could literally see stars in her eyes. Eleven torturous hours of putting off her bathroom breaks and downing several litres of liquid now threatened to destroy her reputation and that too in front of Miorine and Suletta. She held her breath and inched towards the bathroom. Her thighs chafing and rubbing each other. That 40 feet distance took over a minute to complete she finally reached the door of the bathroom.

Her desperation shot up multiple times just by looking at the words “Ladies Toilet”. Her body was in overdrive now - sweating and trembling. It was a now-or-never situation. Her body seemed minutes away from explosion, and yet, to her dread, all the stalls inside were occupied. The relief was still so far from her. She clutched her crotch nearly piercing the fabric of her tight pants with her sharp nails. Her face contorted in a frantic grimace as she muttered silent pleas.

"Please, please, just one empty stall," she whispered through gritted teeth. Her legs, wobbled like noodles. Each step towards the next stall was a battle won and lost at the same time. Her fingers gripped the door handles tighter than a predator pins its prey. "Come on, come on," she urged herself, her voice a desperate plea for mercy. Her bladder bomb could detonate any second. She pressed her palm against her lower abdomen, feeling the agonizing swell of discomfort. "I can't... I can't hold on much longer," she muttered under her breath, her voice shaking as she fought back tears of frustration.

"Please, just one of you, finish up and leave," Prospera silently implored, her eyes shooting from stall to stall, searching for any sign of movement. But her pleas fell on deaf ears as the sound of loud pisses and flushes continued to torture her. Her breaths came in shallow, ragged gasps. She couldn't afford to wait, but the bathroom occupants were oblivious to her plight. Her eyes darted wildly, scanning for any sign of hope, but every stall remained stubbornly occupied.

Tears rolled down from her eyes as she felt another spurt leak into her underwear. Her muscles could give up any second, ready to stage a rebellion of epic proportions. Every muscle screamed for release, and her bladder threatened to unleash its torrential fury at any moment. She squeezed her eyes shut, attempting to use sheer willpower to halt the inevitable. Her body language was personification of intense struggle—her legs quivered, shoulders hunched, and face was scrunched up. She did not want to surrender to nature's call.

But as seconds turned into minutes, and the occupants of the stalls showed no signs of budging, Prospera's composure began to unravel. The bathroom door shook as she pounded it with frustration, her voice rising in an anguished plea for someone, anyone, to hasten their exit. Her frantic mind churned, desperately seeking a solution. She weighed the pros and cons of dashing to the men's restroom, and it appeared more and more lucrative. Seeing no other option, she turned around to exit and there she was Suletta, looking at her mother in such a vulnerable state. That was the final nail in the coffin “Mother! I can’t believe - you are bursting to pee!”

Every bit of energy was required to keep the flood contained. Yet Prospera dared to utter a plea, “S-Suletta. . . G-GO!” Each escaping word dropped like a bomb on her throbbing bladder. And finally, her dam broke. The piss did not just come out, it literally erupted. In spite of the multiple layers of fabric clinging to her skin, the sound of her piss overpowered the noise coming from all other stalls. It was ferocious. Her light grey trousers were now a shade of black, drenched in piss. Rivulets gushed out from her crotch and rapidly gurgled down her legs. Within a few seconds, a puddle formed on the floor. Suletta watched her mother losing all her pent-up pee like a waterfall.

The puddle grew with such rapidity that it spread across to the stalls around drawing curses from inside. Prospera shuddered as her bladder continued to deflate. All the pee that gushed out of her sent tremors down her privates, something which she had not experienced before. Inside her mask, her eyes were half closed-half open as if she was high. Her lips remained parted and faint moans filled the bathroom. Her hydration regime, her pride, her willingness to not accept her needs and her tight clothes all formed the perfect concoction of this wet disaster. The pressure inside her was so intense that for the first minute, the bulge of her bladder refused to deflate. Only in the second minute, the bulge started deflating. It was clear that Prospera was holding way over her limits, and she valiantly fought of her bathroom needs over 12 hours.

At that moment, Prospera’s bladder didn’t just expel all the piss, but it washed away all of her pride and dignity that she had so meticulously formed in front of her daughter. Things were never going to be the same for her.

Hi All Omo Lovers! Presenting to you the first two parts of a three part novel. It was one of my best commissions and I am really proud of it. If you like a little bit of drama and romance, then this one is for you. Presenting to you -

Not Even at Home Volume 2 Part 1 of 3:

Prologue: Hi! I'm Rex, and by this time you might already know how I absolutely love holding my pee to the absolute limits and even beyond. Thanks to my parents who raised me under strict discipline. This is one life skill I will be forever grateful to them for. Of late, I started to feel that my bladder was invincible, and nothing could break it. Even though I started pushing myself harder to hold longer and more volume, I was losing my ability to stay calm and hide it. More often than not, I started squirming at home and even in front of my parents when they visited me.

To ensure that I don’t go astray, my parents decided to set me up with a girl. In India we call that as “Arranged Marriage”. It that had me feeling like a deer caught in the headlights. They sought a girl from a very reputed family. Her family, like mine, was known for their philanthropy, polished behaviour, and most importantly strict discipline. So, naturally, I was feeling the pressure to make a good impression, but little did I know what was in store for me.

The Airport Pickup I was supposed to meet her on the following weekend. On Friday, I took a flight right after work. While in the cab towards the airport, I distinctly remember my father calling me to say, “Don’t let your cocky attitude screw this up. Sobhita is a proper lady. BEHAVE YOURSELF while with her.”

“Behave yourself” was a family code to warn me that I was not supposed to pee no matter what. I brushed it off knowing that my bladder could handle anything easily.

I slowly walked out of the airport, welcomed by a gust of cool night wind. My bladder made its presence felt. It was two hours past the time I would normally allow myself to go. My jeans were tight and left no space for my bladder to expand. My watch told I had been holding it in for nearly 26 hours. I was not bursting per se, but I had to constantly clench my muscles to keep the tide in check. Imagine that feeling when you clench the pressure subsides for a few minutes before coming back. I longingly looked at the door of the airport restrooms knowing that I was not supposed to pee where I was going. Suddenly, I got a phone call from an unknown number.

“Hi! I’m Nihita, Sobhita’s younger sis. Be there at arrival gate . . .” She stopped talking abruptly and the silence was filled by a pronounce groan from her. “Just – Just be there at the gate I will reach in 10”. Those 10 minutes were gruellingly slow. All the beer from my office party, earlier in the evening, was making its way into my bladder. I cursed myself for it.

Soon a car stopped in front of me, and the window rolled down. “Hi, Rex! I’m Nihita" she said, her voice high-pitched and bubbly. Before I could answer, she stepped off the car and hugged me tight. My heart was racing. It took me a good few seconds before I could answer. She was HOT. I mean, the amount of cleavage on display could put pornstars to shame. Her boobs were huge, obviously fake, but HUGE! And the little black dress she wore, seemed more like an undersized vest stolen from a guy. The way it clung to her tiny waist and her bubble butt was titillating, to say the least. I imagined whether Sobhita would be equally hot.

“You know you’re one of the very few guys who actually looked into my eyes while talking!” She winked. I was blushing at her compliment. “Do you mind driving the car back home?” She asked, seemingly bouncy and fidgety.

Alarms started ringing in my head. I could hardly concentrate on keeping up with small talk, let alone drive in an unknown city with a painfully full bladder. But the way she asked was enough to push myself into the driver seat. “Everything OK?” I asked her as I locked my seat belt. My bladder screamed at me with protest, but I silenced it by clenching the muscles hard.

“I AM ABSOLUTELY BURSTING FOR A PEE!” She curtseyed. I was taken aback for a bit. This was the polar opposite of what my parents told me about the family. Nihita was certainly unabashed with the concept of “Being Ladylike”. I didn’t mind though and secretly felt proud of acting strong in front of her.

As we crawled through the traffic, my dick ached from the strain of being so hard and containing the added pressure of the seat belt. When I looked at Nihita, she sheepishly smiled to me and tried to maintain small talk. But she was way past her limits. The seat belt squished her bladder. It looked more like a road between the mountains.

“Should I stop at a public restroom?” I was genuinely worried.

“Shhhh! I am not supposed to pee. . . I got this under control” Nihita tried to sound cheerful but the strain in her voice said otherwise. She was maddeningly desperate; I could say for sure. Her words “Not supposed to pee” sticked to my mind. Once we crossed the city limits and headed towards the residential district, her seat belt was off, and she curled onto the seat. Just as we entered the colony, Nihita bit her lips, took a deep breath and sat into her seat properly. Her face contorted with all the efforts.

“STOP! STOP! STOP!” Nihita pleaded.

As soon as I pulled over, she got down from the car and slammed the door. Her hands flew down to her crotch doing a full-blown pee dance. She swore some of the unholiest words as she dialled someone on her phone. “Sobhita! I’m almost home!” Nihita didn’t realize I could hear her voice, albeit faintly. What followed, was really entertaining.

“I know I was not supposed to stop before reaching but you didn’t respond to any of my texts.”

. . .

“What do you mean you didn’t understand? I don’t type very well when I AM THIS FULL!”

. . .

"No, he cannot hear me. I'm standing outside the car at the rear.” I figured she didn’t want me to see or hear her. But I had put the car on reverse and the camera allowed me to feast my eyes on her squirming.

. . .

“Dee! Can’t you just help me for one day? Its been 18 hours!” Nihita’s voice was rising with anger.

. . .

“I know you are holding it too and you still won’t go! Don’t rub it my face every time.”

. . .

“EXCUSE ME! It was you who sent me out to the airport. I missed my schedule because of that. It’s not my fault!” Nihita’s legs were crossed tight. “Okay okay! You win! I will hold somehow hold it somehow!” She hung up the phone.

I hurriedly put the car back into neutral and took my hand away from my crotch. My heart was pounding with a concoction of nervousness, excitement, and arousal. “Everything OK?” I tried to act nonchalantly.

“I am pissed off.” Nihita turned towards me trying her best to keep her hands from clutching herself. “I missed my only chance to pee today because of Sobhita and now she tells me that its my fault for not reaching home in time.”

“Strict bathroom rules, I suppose?” I asked. I too was raised under the same disciplinarian schedule. “I can understand.” I tried to console her.

“I don’t mind holding it. . . In fact, I love holding it, but I got a little careless today. I could have peed earlier in the day, but I over-estimated my capacity.” She paused for a second. “If my parents find out that I am taking to a guy I just met about holding and stuff, I swear they would kill me.” Nihita pouted while showing me her bladder bulge.

“Is Sobhita also in the same situation, just like you?” I was intrigued.

“Jeez you can’t ask me something like that about my sister!” Nihita playfully punched me.

As we entered thought the grand metal gate, “A tip of advice - DO NOT ASK anyone at home for a toilet. They take holding very VERY seriously”. Nihita warned as I drove ahead.

Dinner As we stepped out of the car, Sobhita’s family nearly drowned me with greetings and garlands. Eavesdropping the phone call had left me flustered and horny, but gravity reminded me of the bucket load of piss I was holding in. I could barely make out their faces as I struggled to maintain my composure. But more than all this what shocked me was Nihita’s absolute change in demeanour. Minutes ago, she was bobbing up and down, as if her bladder could explode any second and now, she behaved as if she didn’t need to go at all empty. The only giving sign was her sweaty forehead and the huge bulge in her bladder.

As we made our way inside, Sobhita's father chatted with me about various topics. Sobhita’s mother on the other hand took Nihita inside hurriedly. I tried my best to engage in the conversation, but my mind was still re-playing the entire conversation over and over again. I could feel my dick throbbing with arousal and rising pressure. I thought of unbuttoning my jeans quietly under my shirt, but suddenly I heard a new voice calling my name. Within a blink of any eye, my dick got even harder. I had never felt so turned on just by listening to my name. I raised my head up and found a goddess standing in front of me. Okay – not a literal goddess, but a young lady who was no less than a goddess.

“I’m Sobhita. I’m sorry I couldn’t come to receive you earlier.” Her voice was so husky and seductive. She was draped in a saree. I was mesmerized by her perfect black hair, dark brown eyes and a tightly squeezed pair of boobs, under a tiny little blouse. I thought Nihita had the biggest boobs I had seen but Sobhita outdid Nihita by leaps and bounds. seemed to outdo her in every aspect. Everything about her was so elegant, so fluidic - Be it the way she offered me water or helped me take my jacket off. I really couldn’t say that she was 30 as my father told.

I greeted her back and tried to make small talk with her as she served dinner. I was relieved to have something to take my mind off the discomfort. But as I ate, I could feel my bladder throw tantrums again. The water was making its way down. I tried to subtly shift in my seat to ease the tension, but it was no use. The moment I realized Sobhita was watching me intently, I stopped any movements whatsoever and held my breath to calm my dick down.

As dinner ended, Sobhita showed me the room for the night. I followed her over the staircase ogling at her impossibly curvaceous figure.

“This used to be my room earlier, but we turned it into a guestroom during renovations. This is your room for the night! The bathroom inside does not have a WC though, I’m sure you won’t need it.” Sobhita stated plainly.

“Of course! I can easily manage.” I thanked her with a panic-stricken voice.

“Manage?” She raised her brows. “I expected more of a . . . Never mind.” I could sense disappointment in her voice.

“You expected more of a - -?” I asked. My body arching forward as my bladder shot a particularly strong spasm down through my pee hole.

“I don’t need one.” She calmly said and bade me goodnight.

I was taken aback by her gesture. Just like Nihita said earlier, Sobhita did seem to take holding very seriously and I was expected to do so as well. Perhaps that was a test of endurance that I HAD to pass in order to marry her.

Waterfall I never realized when I fell asleep. And somehow, my bladder expanded overnight accommodating all the fluids from the day. The stinging pressure waves were replaced by a dull but manageable ache. I freshened up and went downstairs, albeit slowly so as to not jolt my bladder.

Sobhita was sitting in the porch swing, sipping fruit juice from a huge jar, and talking to someone. I couldn't help but admire her beauty. Today she was dressed in a beautiful crimson saree and an extremely fitting blouse. Her boobs threatened to tear the seams apart. She was even more beautiful in the morning light, and I felt myself becoming more and more smitten by her. Nihita was seated right next to her wearing an eye-wateringly tight salwar suit. It was easy to tell that she had not relieved herself. Her legs were crossed tight a pretzel, body glistening with sweat and a rigid posture.

But I was hooked to Sobhita. I was trying to understand if she too needed to pee. I was looking for any signs whatsoever, but I could not figure it out from afar. The only sign was her legs being crossed tightly or so it appeared under the saree. I felt frustrated with the way she had draped it around herself, hiding her bladder underneath. I didn’t hear a single flush ever since I reached their place the previous night. I assumed she must have been relieved herself before my arrival or perhaps she was holding it since last evening too.

I was yearning to find out but lo and behold! A shock awaited me as I made my way to the porch. My parents had arrived in the wee hours of the morning. They shot me a death glare as I took a seat next to them. “Why did you not tell me you guys were joining too? I thought I was just supposed to meet Sobhita, take her out and that was it.” I whispered to my dad. My dad smiled to all the members present there, before pulling me the side.

“That’s not how Indian marriages work! Both sides meet and only then the guy and the girl are allowed to go out together.” His grip tightening around my arm. “And what was all about last night? I heard from Sobhita’s mother that you said you could ‘somehow Manage’ without a toilet. – It’s a sign of weakness! You could have said you didn’t need a toilet at all and actually act like a man!”

“All right Dad enough!” I pulled away my arm only to upset my bladder. “Sobhita is not even holding it, just look at her. She is perfectly relaxed as opposed to Nihita!”

“Nihita is still young and needs a lot of training – just like you I suppose. And as far as Sobhita is concerned, you have no clue at all!” He backfired and took us back to the porch where we finished the rest of the breakfast.

When we returned to the porch, Sobhita came up with a plan to visit a famous waterfall with both the families and return by the evening. The waterfall had a religious significance and taking a bath underneath before starting any auspicious activity would bring good fortune. My jaws were on the ground. I was not prepared – this was not a part of the plan at all. My bladder seared with pain. As much as I loved the feeling of being under such a tremendous pressure, all this family drama was making me nervous and more desperate by the minute. I was holding it for 36 hours now and had chugged over 4 liters of fluids easily.

“Will you be all right till we return?” My mother asked Sobhita as if she knew something which I didn’t. She hesitated for a second as she looked at her mother, who in turn signalled her to answer in an affirmative.

“Rest assured Aunty! I will be just fine. We have been raised to be proper at all times.” Sobhita said gently nursing her bladder. Her mother caught a glimpse of her inadvertent fault and frowned upon it. She asked her house help to refill her jug with juice. It was a tense moment and could be understood only by someone with trained eyes, like me. I saw Sobhita was tightly gripping the seat of the swing, as she started sipped away the entire jar in one go.

Right after breakfast, Sobhita asked me to drive, making sure everyone heard her. “Rex, do you mind driving us to the spot?” I reluctantly accepted the keys of the car and caught a hint of relief wash over her face.

“Dee” Nihita whispered to Sobhita, just as she was about to step in the car. “Don’t be a fool! You have been skipping all your pees and Mother just made you drink two jars of juice. This trip is a suicide. Just go now before you guys hit the road – I will cover for you!”. I fiddled with the car dashboard pretending not to hear them.

“Shut the fuck up Nihita! You’re not making it any easier by reminding me about it. It took me a hell lot of trouble to convince Mom to allow you to stay back so that you can piss in peace. If she catches us talking about this, you and I both will be screwed. . .” Sobhita paused to calm herself. “Listen, I’m very uncomfortable, but I can and must control myself like a lady. No matter what how big the lake inside me grows!” Believe me, hearing Sobhita’s word, I could have shot a load or two inside my pants. “How much is she really holding!” I yearned to know.

Soon we were on the road with Sobhita in the seat adjacent to me. I caught her mince slightly as she put on the seat belt. Our mothers were in the middle row and the fathers in the last row of the car. I drove away, with my hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. 40 hours’ worth of piss sloshed inside me. I tried my best to focus on the road ahead, but my mind kept wandering to my bladder and hers. I quickly glanced at Sobhita and found her already sipping a can of juice. As soon as one got over her mother passed her another one. I just couldn’t wrap my head around this blatant display. On one hand she mentioned she was uncomfortable and on the other hand she chugged can after can. Sobhita was full of mystery. No wonder there was a tent in my pant.

“You should slow down on the juices, Sobhita.” My mother whispered to her, genuinely worried. “It’s OK aunty, I live with WAYYY more than this, inside me every day.” I could see a glint of joy in my mother’s eyes, as if she had already found herself the perfect daughter-in-law.

A little later, I turned the AC temperature further lower as all the sweating annoyed me. Little did I know that the AC would do the trick. As soon as the cabin became colder, I saw her grit her teeth and gulp down her throat. Her legs started bobbing up and down albeit slowly but definitely. Her seating became more rigid as if she was subconsciously trying to give more room for her bladder to expand. An hour later she even refused to take any more cans of juice. My mother ordered me to finish them, much to my dismay.

3 hours later, we reached the destination. The waterfall was pretty far but we could still hear it’s thunderous sound. My bladder was screaming. Thanks to my mother’s order I consumed 3 full cans of juice on top of all the water already coursing in my system. It was physically painful to stand up straight but each time I looked at Sobhita somehow seemed unfazed. Perhaps, getting out of the car, away from the AC helped her re-gain control. Her parents insisted Sobhita to show us around. For someone holding a bladder that full, Sobhita still guided us without any hesitation. But something didn’t feel right. Were her steps getting shorter? Or was she stopping more often on the pretext of clicking photos? Why was one of her fists clenched tightly? I was watching her like a hawk. To the unversed, she would have looked like she was feeling uneasy, not like someone who had been battling her bladder, for God knows how long!

By 2pm in the afternoon, both our parents finally decided it was time to enter the waterfall to purify themselves. It was a ritual they wanted to follow before entering the temple. My fists were tightly closed turning my knuckles white. Sobhita on the other hand, was gently swaying her hips from side to side. No matter how good she was at hiding it from others I could see the panic rising in her eyes. Imagine that you are about to lose control and instead of going to the toilet your taken to a mammoth sized waterfall. It was driving us crazy but we had to pretend to be strong and calm. Just as we neared the dreaded waterfall, her mother came running and took Sobhita to the side. Me being me, stepped closer to them every time they were not looking at me.

“You are going to stay out and you know why! I don’t want you to give you a chance of wetting yourself under the water.” Her mother said sternly.

“Mother! Please trust me! I know I showed momentary weakness earlier, but I understand that I cannot let my silly bodily needs come in the way of our pride. I will expect you to be just as tough with me.” Her mother seemed pleased with her. She kissed Sobhita on her forehead and hobbled towards the waterfall.

“Hey!” I approached Sobhita after her mother left. “All OK with you guys?”

“Yes. Never been better.” She lied through her teeth.

“I assumed you would join the others in the waterfall. Thought you loved it?”

“I love it, but right now I just want to go away from here”.

“Me too Sobhita, me too!” I said with a strained voice. She immediately looked at me with suspicion in her eyes.“We haven’t had a chance to talk much since I arrived”. I covered up quickly.

“Rex,” She said trying to keep her voice as calm as possible “All I can say is my mind is a little pre-occupied at the moment but its good to have your company.” I could see her getting antsy.

“Can I help you with it?”

“Like I said, I just want to go away from the waterfall. Anywhere but the waterfall!” Sobhita’s control seemed to slip now and so was mine. Pee rushed to the tip of my hole threatening to come out. My gut ached. It was not possible for me to clench any harder. We slowly started to walk back towards the car when her heel got stuck, and she lost her balance. I sprang in my action and caught her in my arms. But what happened next dropped my jaws to the ground!

One of my hands was right on her bladder. My eyes widened in disbelief when I sensed its contour. Had my eyes been closed, I could have mistaken it for a massive bowling ball. I had never felt anything like that before. In comparison my bladder felt miniscule. The sudden jerk may have made her bladder revolt angrily. She shut her eyes tight and pursed her lips, in an attempt to hold back the tidal wave of piss rushing to her pee hole. Her nails dug into my arms. She froze in an awkward position for nearly a minute before getting back up. But once she opened her eyes, her demeanour changed as if nothing happened. Her body was drenched with sweat though.

“Was that your bladder Sobhita?” I found myself asking, simply unable to bear the suspense anymore. She looked at me with vapid eyes, nodding in affirmation.

“How is it so big? You must be absolutely brimming for a relief.”

“Rex let’s just say I am a little full at the moment but nothing I cannot handle. It’s been only 45 hours yet.” She responded straightforwardly. “I am not even thinking of a bathroom right now even though my bladder is complaining about needing one.”

“You’re incredible. I have never met any girl as strong as you, ever in my life!” I found myself gushing compliments as arousal replaced my intense urge to pee.

“Well, I am a lady, Rex. Girls need relief but not me. I can simply control such things as I was raised that way.”

“Yes, my lady, I just hope this secret just remains between us.”

“It will.” She gave me a genuine ear-to-ear smile, “But only if you can keep up with me.”

That was just the beginning. I didn’t know if she liked me or not, but I felt strongly attracted to her. But the ordeal was far from over. Sudden rains on our way back, made it one hell of a challenge for me at least. My bladder was severely overworked even though it was corked up for the same duration as hers. Unlike her, even a roadside tree would be able to tell that my bladder was going to explode if another ml of pee tried to enter it. I could literally taste pee at the back of my tongue. My lower back ached as if someone hit it with hammer. The only thing which prevented an outburst were her words, “Keep up with me”.

Sobhita on the other hand remained poised as ever. The bulge in her abdomen though had grown to such proportions that even the cleverly draped saree could no longer hide it. I simply couldn’t fathom how she continued to talk normally to everyone in the car and chug everything that her mother gave her, on the pretext of maintaining hydration. She gave me a knowing look every time she gulped down fluids. Her eyes told me that she was battling some of the most intense waves there was. But she didn’t utter an “Uff” throughout the return journey. She truly was a Goddess, who’s bladder of steel contained a dam of hot piss for over 2 days now. How she appeared to not let it show on her face, would remain a mystery to me. I was determined to find it out and couldn’t wait for the next meeting.

House Hunting Three weeks since passed since our First Meeting. I and Sobhita had exchanged phone numbers and were in constant touch. Though she never openly spoke once about her holding adventures. On the other hand, I had been regularly stretching myself to pee only once every 2 days since then. It was excruciating and exhausting, but I wanted Sobhita in my life – come what may!

On a long weekend, I flew to my hometown to spend time with my parents. I was very excited to show them that I was putting efforts into becoming a proper man, just like they wanted me to be. I landed with what I would say a ticking time bomb in my bladder. I was confident that my parents would appreciate me for finally getting my act together. My bladder was swollen nicely and showed from underneath my jeans.

My plan was to reach home, have a nice refreshing breakfast, without mentioning anything about needing to pee and let my bladder do the talking. Then I would go to the bathroom as if it was nothing and finally enjoy an orgasmic relief. But fate had some other plans for me. The shoe stand near the main door had a pair of exceptionally high heels. I distinctly remember them – they were Sobhita’s! My heart started racing.

“Could it really be her? What the hell is she doing here? Would I be able to go if she’s actually here? Would she make fun of me because of my bulge?” There was a whirlwind of questions in my mind. Before I could process this pleasant shock, the door opened.

“Hi Rex! How are you?” Sobhita greeted me with a warm smile. I was instantly hard. For the first time, I was seeing her in a salwar suit. Her massive rack refused to stay contained in that tight constrictive layer of cloth. It heaved up and down as she breathed. The rest of her attire was flowy and breezy. And as always, I still could not see any bulge, much to my dismay.

“I – I’m good. I didn’t expect you to be here.” I tried to sound as calm as possible.

“You look nervous.” She squinted her eyes taking a good look at me from head to toe and especially my bladder bulge. She bit her lip and gave me a knowing look. I could see she was trying hard to supress a smile.

“It’s nothing – nothing at all.” I lied and came in. My mother and Sobhita exchanged knowing looks. I hurriedly went to my room. I grabbed my dick as tight as I could. The piss wanted out NOW! I was panicking. I know my parents would kick me out if they heard me take a piss while in Sobhita’s presence. The WC was just a few feet away. I glanced in the room to help me find anything to take the edge off, just when my eyes fell on some colourful items in the laundry bag.

I approached it with curiosity and found that it was filled Sobhita’s clothes, a few of her thongs. I greedily picked them up and smelled them. There was an unmistakable smell of pee and a faint pee stain on each of them. “She must have been truly at her limits” I thought to myself and entered the bathroom. I turned on the faucet to wash my face, only to see that the WC was splashed with drops of water and the flush tank was filling up. “Sobhita peed!” I deduced in astonishment. She was not immune to peeing after all or so I thought.

I was tempted to release the gusher I was building for over 40 hours now. With great determination, I resisted the temptation and asked out of the room, even though the insides of my bladder were burning.

“Thank you so much for your understanding Aunty!” I heard Sobhita speak to my Mom.

“We all have our limits dear; I understand.” My mother calmed her.

“So, what brings you here Sobhita?” I started, with a hand inadvertently resting on my bladder.

“I got a job in the city, and it starts in two weeks. I thought of finding a place to rent.” Sobhita said. Her husky voice mixed with her confidence was such a turn on for me.

“Why don't you go out with her and find one?” My Mom yelled back from the kitchen. And thus, after the breakfast loaded with juices, we both stepped out. Upon her insistence I took my bike reluctantly. Getting astride the bike almost tore my muscles. I never hated the sporty stance of it more. But it had its own advantage too. Sobhita had to lean on my back to prevent from falling down. Her firm silicone globes squished against my back every time I braked.

Though, as we sped away there was one more thing that I felt squeezing against my lower back. It felt the same hard and warm ball which I felt during our first meeting. At first I ignored it, dismissing it as my wishful thinking but the ball stayed and made its presence felt. “How is this possible?” I thought to myself. She had just peed. She was thanking my mother as well. How could she have such a gigantic bulge already? I brushed it off just as my overactive imagination. I didn’t say anything to her and neither did she complain against my hard braking. In fact I felt she clutched me tighter. I was having a sitting hard on.

We soon reached a real estate agency and began house hunting for her. We were welcomed with a team lemonade and air conditioned room. I kept an eye on her body language as she explained her requirements to the agent. Third time she didn't even register the AC freezing us. I on the other hand couldn’t stop shifting in my seat. It I didn’t concentrate a leak was imminent. I couldn’t pay any heed to the conversation and thus it came as a shock to me when she agreed to check out all the available apartment right then. I was hoping more of a virtual tour.

“Right now?” I exclaimed.

“Is that a problem Rex?” Sobhita asked with frowned brows.

“No…I mean I was worried about. . .” I pointed towards her bladder.

“Rex, there’s one thing one thing you should know – I am above all such needs and I would appreciate if you could treat me accordingly.” I could sense a bit of anger in her voice.

“Hey, I didn’t mean to offend you”.

“Well, you did already! But I understand why would you think so, given how our last meeting went.” She uncrossed her legs and chugged the glass of water kept in front of her, as if to prove her point. “However, today I am as good as empty!” Given my own eye wateringly desperate situation, I was unable to process how could she be empty and yet have such a hard bladder bulge underneath. “Am I hallucinating!” I thought to myself.

Soon we started off from the agent’s office house hunting for her throughout the city. We just had a few hours before her return flight in the evening. So, we had just a few hours in our hands. But my bladder seemed to have a mind of its own. It was hell bent to interfere with my cognitive functions. With every bump I could feel my bladder bounce inside me causing tremors of vibrations to hit my dick internally. On top of that, my boon became a bane. My bike had a sporty stance.

So, Sobhita leaned on my back throughout the ride, holding me tightly by my waist for support. If my bladder were a balloon, it would have popped then and there. My body shuddered every time I had to brake, raise, stop, alight or even breath. I HAD TO PEE! I WAS BURSTING! Keeping the handle steady seemed an impossible task especially when she kept reminding me to drive a little faster. In the next 3 or 4 hours we visited 9 different apartments. Each time we met the owner, they would offer us something or the other to drink, understandably so, because it was sweltering outside. And Sobhita happily chugged each glass so eagerly, as if it was a sport to fill your bladder rapidly.

“Thank you so much Aunty”.

“My throat is dry as a desert”.

“I feel refreshed now”.

“Nothing better than a glass of lemonade”

For me though, each glass of liquid acted like a blow of hammer to my ballooned bladder. 9 tall glasses of water were too much of an intake for a regular person on a regular day. Not for me. I was beyond frantic, and I couldn’t even enjoy the thrill of having made it so long without a break. 44 hours was already a challenge for me, and this additional water was breaking me down. I could feel my bladder muscles tearing from inside. I looked at Sobhita. She maintained her graceful presence. At that point in time I couldn’t even figure out if she was showing any signs of needing it. Everything was a blur to me. I tried holding the glass tight, but my hands trembled, and I spilled some water.

“Rex! What’s wrong?!” She elbowed me hitting me right on my bladder. I yelped in pain.

“Don’t tell me you need to go already! Your bladder is still soft?” She looked at me like a strict teacher.

“Of. Of course. I just feel bloated with so much water.” I made an excuse which was true to some extent.

“No problem!” She said and in one big swig she downed her glass of water as well as mine. My eyes almost popped out in astonishment. She totalled 11 glasses of water and yet there were no obvious signs 9f needing to go. Just casually crossed legs and arms folded across her chest. I envied her willpower so much.

“I love this place”, Sobhita turned to the agent.

“Are you sure Ma’am? There are issues with the water supply to the WC. There are recurring issues with the STP”.

“So what?”

“I mean, you really won’t have anywhere to go ..if you know what I mean” The agent tried to reason. “The rent is the lowest here though. If you can pay extra to me I will ensure that the supply is fixed”

“No, I don't need a WC, honestly. This condo meets all my requirements, and the rent fits my budget. If all I have to do is not go to the bathroom, in exchange of all the other amenities, I would happily do so. I anyways never need one”.

The agent was shocked, but she anyways closed the deal. Once the agent left, I gasped with discomfort. She came to me, asking if I were OK. I nodded in affirmation and insisted that we return home. 46 hours had passed since my last relief and perhaps 8 hours for her. My balls, my dick and my lower back felt as if a swarm of hornets had attacked them. I had to pause myself , home my breath before getting astride on the bike. My muscles were being pulled apart as my legs parted. And then she got on the bike, putting additional load on me. I had tears in my eyes. I could feel that bulge in her bladder had grown considerably but I brushed it off imagining it to be her bloated belly. My mind was simply too overworked to calculate her volume or scale of desperation. We reached home around half an hour later.

“Rex you need to drive a little faster from next time. We were hardly a mile away from here and it took half an hour. I could have missed my return flight you know.”

If only she knew how long have, I been holding for, perhaps she would have shown some compassion. I didn’t that she was scolding me, having peed just in the morning. I couldn’t answer her though. I was at the last reserves of my strength. I was dreading the stairs, but I had no choice. I took a deep breath and started climbing, with her in front of me. After a step or two, a devastatingly strong wave hit me, that I nearly tripped. This time though, she caught me from falling and my swollen bladder landed in he palm.

“You’re so hard down there already.. Will you be able to hold it, or should I ask Aunty to let you use the bathroom?” She asked. My predicament reminded her of her own needs, albeit not so devastatingly urgent. I couldn’t say whether she genuinely wanted to help me or if it was a tease.

“I... I don’t need Mom to tell me whether I can relieve myself or not. I will h-hold it!” My voice betraying my façade of bravery.

“Really, will you?” My mother suddenly opened the door and signalled Sobhita to give us some privacy. She at once nodded and started walking towards my room. Her stance was arched forward and walk stiff. For a moment I felt as if she was relieved that she could get some privacy. But what happened instead blew my mind.

“Wait here till I come back.” Mom warned me and went to Sobhita.

“Darling are you all right? Feel at home and if you want you can use the bathroom before we start for the airport. I will not say anything to your family” Mom whispered to her.

“Oh no! Not at all Aunty! I am super-comfortable in holding it. It’s what a lady is supposed to do.”

“Are you sure? Your mother told me on phone that you have been training yourself very hard since our first meet. You have held it longer than we expected. I’m must say I’m impressed.”

“Oh why! Thank you Aunty.” Sobhita blushed. “Aunty – may I ask you something though?” My mother eagerly nodded. “Would you really like if I used your bathroom?”

I could see tears of happiness in Mom’s eyes. “If you ask me, I will prefer you to somehow just hold it in. It suits you. But I don’t want to impose anything. . .”

“Say no more Aunty! That’s what I wanted to hear.” Sobhita interrupted, her hips swaying from side to side. “I have never relieved myself outside home and neither will I, today. And I promise you, you will never see me going to the bathroom.” She hugged my Mom tight and went to my room, where Mom made her stay arrangements. Yes, you guessed it right, I was supposed to sleep on the couch.

“When will you learn Rex?” Mom came back to me at the door, “Have we not taught you that it’s very impolite to show your needs to a lady!” My mother pulled me away into her bedroom and locked the door.

“Mom! Do you have any clue how much have I been holding. 48 hours’ worth of pee and I still downed 9 glasses of water in the last 4 hours over what I already drank! I am still dry… Can you appreciate me for once?” I scoffed at her. My body was on overdrive, muscles quivering with this sudden commotion.

“Really! YOU ARE HOLDING? Do you have any clue what’s her situation? Do you any clue how what a dangerously full she is!” She continued yelling at me. “You are whining at merely 48 hours and here she is containing all of it for the nearly 2 and a half days without a flinch!”

“What fullness are you talking about Mom? She peed right before I came home!”

“No, she didn’t! What makes you say that Rex?”

“Mom! Did you see that laundry bag! She left her pee-stained under-wears in it and the flush was getting filled when I went it. . .” Bam! That was it.

“First – the flush was getting refilled because the house-help cleaned the bathroom just a few minutes ago before you arrived.” Mom was furious. “SECONDLY – You check out a girl’s underwear just because it’s in your laundry bag! I NEVER REALIZED THAT YOU WERE SUCH A PERVERT!” A chill went down my spine realizing what a blunder I made. “Those clothes were not hers or from anyone her but . . . It doesn’t matter. What matters is SHE DIDN’T PEE ONCE SINCE SHE CAME HERE!”

“Mom! I – I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean it that way”.

“Too late son! I am going to ask her parents to find someone else for her. You don’t deserve her. She holds such high regards for you. Even though she teases you here and there, she thinks that you are such a strong man. But what did you do? Fiddle with the underwear! Shameless brat!”

I kept pleading Mom to give me a chance to apologize but she turned deaf ears to it. I was locked in the room by Mom and soon she and Sobhita left for the airport, while I continued to squirm and fight with my bladder, which could literally explode any second. I knew Sobhita was beyond my reach now. But I liked her – liked so much. I behaved like a jerk and now the onus was on me to prove my mettle. Would I be able to prove it to her? Or would she reject me for being such a pathetic loser?

Well written, though I'm not a fan of male desperation personally. I'm glad you're writing what you love, though, that's what is most important!

Yes. I thought, why not cover male and female desperation both. It will be enjoyable for those who are into it.

Thank you so much for the compliments. I am striving to write better and better every time. If there is anything which you feel I must improve, please tell me.

As promised , here's the 2nd part of the story. Watch the drama and tension unfold.

Part 2 of 3:

The Handcuff to Redemption My life took a turn south since the embarrassing episode with Sobhita. A few months passed between the last time I saw Sobhita. She blocked me everywhere, WhatsApp, email, social media – EVERYWHERE! I was laid off from work. My parents stopped talking to me. Heck! When I returned to my city, my parents asked didn’t allow me in my own home. I had to rent out a small apartment. It was a dark phase for me.

One evening, I went to a pub. It was a Friday evening and they had arranged for a Bladder Burst event. Those events where they handcuff you to a table and supply unlimited beer till you need to go to the bathroom. Despite all the negativity around I never stopped my habit of holding my pee. Perhaps that was the only thing that have me some semblance of control on my life. Hardly 5 pints later, I could sense pee either at the tip of my dick and I called in for the bouncer to unlock my handcuff. That’s when I heard a commotion from the other corner of the hall. A guy was arguing with a girl.

“I dint believe it... You drank 3 pints, and you still don’t need to go?!” He seemed furious. I chuckled at it and proceeded to go out till I heard him tell again. “You’re a cheat Sobhita! No girl can hold that long!” I stopped in my tracks and rushed to the table. Sobhita was trying to talk him out but the moron with stop. He was unchained and couldn’t even stand still. “If your bladder is tiny and ego is fragile, that’s not my problem.” Sobhita calmly countered that guy. Her words triggered him so much that he almost hit her.

“THAT’S IT BC!” I landed a punch on his face. The next moment the guy was on the floor. Within seconds there was a small puddle on the floor. He lost control of his tiny 1-pint full bladder. The bouncers had to intervene the ruckus and threw him out. I was next. As the bouncer lifted me mid-air, I called her out, “Sobhita, please let me speak to you. For the last time at least!” She considered my request, albeit with reluctance and asked the bouncers to leave me with her. “Though I could have handled him on my own, thank you for standing by me.” She asked me to sit next to her. I was nervous, happy, and horny all at one instant. I don’t know why but every time I looked at her, my body somehow pumped all my blood to my dick.

“Sobhita... Thank you for letting me sit with you”, I began anxiously, pushing away all my horny thoughts to the back of my mind. “I tried contacting you several times, but you blocked me everywhere... I am sorry for what happened Sobhita.” As I spoke a waiter hand-cuffed me to the table again. More beer was served.

“Rex, I am not interested in your apology. I want to know what made you think that I would pee at your home? You really thought I would wet my underwear so easily? I was starting to like you and then your words dropped like a bomb. For me, if anyone underestimates my capacity it’s a deal breaker for me.” Her brows were furrowed and eyes staring into my soul.

“It was first thing that crossed my mind when I saw that wet... It’s only human. I don’t know what your true limits are or if you were at your limits. But I swear I never intended to underestimate you. That day even I was holding for close to 2 and a half days. I was resolved to not pee in front of you because I respect you”, I opened the can and passed it to her. “I know Mom told you everything and you think of me as a pervert, but I genuinely like you and want to man up for you.”

She accepted the beer, “No that’s where you went wrong. I don’t care if you sniff my underwear or fantasize with me. When it comes to me, I can hold as long as I want, and I want people to know that I am strong. As I speak with you, I want you to know that I am in total control despite all the beer, despite all the water that I had since the morning, despite these life-squeezing formals.” In a minute she downed the pint looking straight into my eyes. I followed suit.

Now, she was on her fourth and I was on my sixth. At that point my dick felt like a bee stung it. Her words gave me a brilliant idea though. I immediately signalled the waiter to bring me a beer tower. It was a gallon sized jar that came with a tap. I saw her eyes lit up. “Rex, I just told you that I am holding a lot. And you’re still asking for more beer.”, she raised her brows. “Isn’t this what you want – to be able to hold longer and drunk more? See, I get you. I want you to give me a chance to make things right.” I played my trump card.

“You really enjoy this don’t you?” She clasped the sides of the jar and inadvertently crossed her legs, albeit tightly. “I think this is too easy for you. And I also know how important it is for you to always hold it. Just like you even I have been training myself to hold my pee. I am fascinated by you and your capacity, and you can bet on me that I will push you hard, so hard it would be impossible for you to imagine. I genuinely want a second chance...” I blurted out.

“Well... You know what, I want a partner who thinks exactly like that and supports me. That guy who brought me here said he could hold with me. But 2 points down the table, he was shamelessly squirming. He yelled at me to go pee so that he could satisfy his ego of holding longer than me. All I want you is to forget that I have any limits. If you want to give this a shot, you must push me harder. We can spend the day together tomorrow where you have to convince me that you are the only one who can get close to breaking me.” She said plainly. “And of course, while you are pushing me, I expect you to hold with me.”

I gulped down my throat. My manhood was as stiff as steel and at the same time I had goosebumps all over my body. “Before I give my answer to you Sobhita, I want to know what you think of me beyond holding?”

“You will get that answer in due time. Right now, you should be happy knowing that I liked that you owned your mistake and that you are willing to push me harder. I wish you did that earlier...” She innocently smiled and filled the mugs. Soon another pint made its way to our bladders. “What do you mean?”

“You simply wrote or voice messages me – ‘please talk to me’, ‘let me speak to you’, and what not. You could have simply written me about your thoughts”, she gently held my hands. I was splitting at seams, honestly and all I could do was nod. “So, are you ready?” She finally smiled.

Brunch I emptied myself exactly at midnight, after returning from the pub. My eyes could pop out from the sockets with the pressure built up inside me. I wondered if Sobhita was still holding, or she peed too. Soon I dozed off dreaming about her. The next morning, I went for a jog as usual, skipping my morning pee. I had resolved myself that I would not pee that day or longer if need be. I had a slight bulge in my bladder, which told me that not my kidneys had not processed all the beer from last night. Anyway, I took a detour and passed through her area.

As I was crossing Sobhita’s apartment building, I saw her entering the lobby with an empty bucket in her hand. I didn’t think much of it, but it was uncharacteristic of her to step out just in an oversized tank top, and undies. The loose fabric of her top hung from her silicone globes and her abs looked absolutely flat. She has definitely taken a pee, I told myself and carried on with the remainder of my jog with a sly grin of my face. I had a 7-hour advantage on her.

After my breakfast, I sent her a text, “We are going to do a rapid hold today. You better arrive start tanking up - 2 litres minimum - I dare you.” Almost instantly, by phone buzzed with a notification. It was from Sobhita. As a guy, getting a reply that fast from a girl was no less than a high. The text read,

“What’s a rapid hold? BTW I am working through my 1st litre.”

“I will explain you at Brunch. See you at 12”, I quickly texted back. What worried me was that she was already beating me at it. Without a second thought, I chugged down an entire litre and cracked open the next one. Needless to say, my bladder was not very happy, but I remained firm. By the time I was supposed to step out, 2 litres were sloshing in my belly. I was not at my limits per se, but the pressure was definitely there.

We were supposed to meet at a plush café. I arrived first and they gave me a seat in the open yard. Fortunately, and unfortunately, it was hot. Even before she had arrived, I had downed a lemonade and got the same for her. 2.2 litres of water were being pumped into my organ. It was going to be a good challenge, I thought to myself. A little later she arrived. I had a swarm of butterflies in my stomach. I could never figure out how she managed to squeeze herself in such skin-tight clothes. She donned a high-waisted blue jeans coupled with a low-cut neon green crop top and matching heels. I had to dab my drool with a tissue as I saw her strut towards me. Slow motion in real life I tell you. As she came close, I hurriedly got up from my chair to pull a chair for her. She turned a blind eye to it and hastily downed the tall lemonade. “I am sorry. It’s just that I don’t feel anything yet.” She tried to explain her act while I still remained confused. “Sorry??”

“Rex, I have consumed 2 litres in the last 5 hours as you said but I still don’t feel anything.” She shook her hands in the air gesturing a 2 and 5 with her fingers.

“That’s a good thing, right?” I forced a smile. Unlike her, I was at a solid 6/10 already and the pressure was growing at a worrisome pace.

“It means I am dehydrated, Rex. That’s never a good thing.”

I pounced on the opportunity, “Keep sending the lemonades until we ask you to stop.” I instructed the waiter. As the waiter brought the refills she asked curiously “Now, tell me what’s a rapid hold, Rex?” A grin formed on my face. It was a dream come true to have the girl of my dreams asking about all this and also willing to do it. “If you still haven’t guessed – drink a ton of liquids in a very short time to get excruciatingly full and then endure as you would normally do. Do you think you will be able to take it?”

“Well, I must clarify a few things.” She took another swig at the new glass of lemonade. I followed suit. We both were at 2400 ml now. “I feel guilty when I am empty. I like being under control. Lastly – You will have to try really REALLY hard to break me!”

“Last night’s ‘Bladder Burst’ gave me this idea of doing a rapid hold. I reckon, given the gigantic bladder you have, even this rapid hold won’t have any effect on you.” I sighed. Her confidence was making me nervous.

“I don’t think I have a gigantic bladder. Just like any other person I too start feeling the pressure in a few hours. The only difference is that I simply don’t care. It’s my bladder’s job to hold it and I use it to its full potential.”

“Why would you say you don’t have a gigantic bladder? I have seen you continue to hold even beyond 2 full days!” I was astonished.

“THAT’S NOT ENOUGH! Anyone can hold it for 2 days. I want to have absolute mastery over my bladder. Just imagine, if monks can attain super high levels of control over their bodies, or Naga Sadhus who can live without food for days, I don’t see a reason why I shouldn’t be able to contain my waters to my fancies.”

“Going by that logic, rapid holds can make it difficult. Isn’t it?”

“I don’t know. It might be challenging, and I might even relish it. But it all depends on how hard you push me. This is a new challenge for me – I have always been religious about well-paced-hydration, but I have never tried combining rapid-volume and duration. It would be a great surprise Mom and Dad.”

“That’s interesting. If I may ask, how’s the new challenge going so far?” I tried my luck.

“I will let you guess. By the end of the day, I want you to estimate how full I am...” My heart was beating at the back of my throat. My boner could have torn away my jeans, I swear. The rest of the brunch was uneventful, and we left from there around 3pm. 6 glasses of lemonade were flowing to our bladders. I had a strong ache in my bladder. Rapid desperation was not my cup of tea, but I wanted to push myself for her. I cleared the bill trying to stand as normally as possible. I glanced at her. Her once flat belly was now replaced with a moderate bulge. Her legs were crossed casually and hands on her waist. 15 hours for me and 8 for her.

“Still feel dehydrated?” I playfully asked her.

“Oh, it’s long gone.. Right after the 2nd one”, she smiled at me and put her arm into mine as walked towards her car. Little did she realize how happy and horny I felt at that moment. The only thing that bugged me was her mobile. It kept buzzing every few minutes. I wished she kept it aside.

Car Shopping Sobhita unveiled her plan of getting herself a new car. So, our next destination was a car dealership. Watching her drive was a feast for my eyes. Every bump in the road made her boobs heave up and down. She followed it up by trying to pull her top to prevent any wardrobe malfunction. Second, the bulge in her belly was squeezed under the tight seat belt. Though she showed nothing on her face, she grabbed her thigh tightly with her hand.

Soon we reached the showroom. When Sobhita finally unbuckled her seat belt her face was awash with relief. As I was stepping outside the car, I saw her tug the vice-like waist band away from her belly. Her skin was bruised red. Once she was out of the car, her demeanour changed completely. She started walking towards the showroom as if nothing happened.

The insides of the showroom felt like mini-Antarctica. I clenched by butt and my manhood with all my might. The 6/10 suddenly shot up to 8/10. I found myself tapping my foot. Sobhita on the other hand had goosebumps even on her face. She stood with her folded arms. In a moment’s notice her nose and ears turned red. I wondered how her bladder was faring. “W-why is it so cold?” She asked the salesgirl who came to us. I could see Sobhita subtly squirm. “The remote has malfunctioned and we are unable to raise the temperature Ma’am”, the salesgirl profusely apologised. “Could you get us something hot to drink?” I asked the salesgirl. Soon I and Sobhita had a tall cup of black tea in our hand. She finished it in no time and asked for another. I kept a close eye on her intake. But she seemed to be the least bothered about it. I made sure to keep up with her and asked for a refill too. In the back of my mind, I was worried if I would be able to hold it in if I kept drinking at that rate.

The next hour was spent in checking out the collection of cars they had. It meant lots of bending to step in and out of the car. Lots of walking and talking. All while we kept chugging the deliciously warm tea. Around 5pm, 17 hours for me and 10 for her, I saw Sobhita standing with her hands on her waist. Her body slightly arched forward and face glistening with sweat. Literally a gallon of liquid was pushing against our control.

“Ma’am, if you need to use the restroom its right there”, the salesgirl pointed towards it.

“What made you say that?” Sobhita brows were furrowed.

“Oh.. It’s cold in here plus you had tea, so I suggested”, the salesgirl nervously responded. When I glanced at her, I realised that she herself was squirming. Her face was flustered. She kept shuffling her legs and changed her standing positions.

“Sobhita”, I whispered, “Looks like she herself needs to go and is embarrassed to admit.” Sobhita’s eyes lit up. To my surprise, Sobhita asked the girl to take her to the restroom. The salesgirl wasted no time and immediately escorted Sobhita towards the ladies room. She was seemingly at the end of her tether while Sobhita followed her with a slightly rigid gait. My heart sank. I couldn’t believe that Sobhita would be tempted to relieve herself so easily. But this time I chose not to say anything and witness the scene.

A few minutes later they both emerged from the restroom. The salesgirl was visibly relieved. Her face was no longer red or sweaty. Sobhita on the other hand seemed a little quieter. The liquid was catching up with her. The bulge was much bigger now. The buttons on her jeans were stretching the holes, the zip was fighting with it’s life to not tear open. I could clearly see the contour of her bubble butt change every time she clenched.

As were leaving from the dealership with brochures and all, the salesgirl whispered to Sobhita. “Ma’am, I know I shouldn’t be asking this but why didn’t you use the restroom? Did you find it dirty or something?”

“Don’t worry dear! I can control myself as long as I want,” Sobhita’s nonchalant response left the salesgirl and me, dumbfounded.

Desperate Games “Hey Rex”, Sobhita suddenly threw the keys of her car to me, “drive us to the multiplex”. I was resisting a gallon trying to erupt from my dick and here I had to act strong. I smiled and got in. A sharp wave rushed to the tip as I fastened the seat belt. Sobhita on the other hand, arched her body forward, forming an arc shaped hollow space between the seat and her lower back.

“Sobhitaaaaaa”, I teased her, “All OK?”

“Shut up Rex!” She tucked away the sweaty strands of hair behind her ear. “I don’t need to pee at all...”

“When did I ever ask about peeing? I was referring to your weirdly contorted sitting position.” I tried to poke fun at her, but her glare was scary enough to put me on back foot.

“Just kidding...”, I quickly tried to change the subject, “So Sobhita, time for quick feedback. You asked me to push you hard. How am I doing?”

A naughty smile formed on her lips. It was a kind of smile I was seeing for the first time. She slowly uncrossed her tightly clad legs and turned towards me. I caught her wince for a microsecond as the belt dug further into her swollen bladder. “You need to try HARDER”, she leaned closer to me and whispered into my ear, with a husky voice. I almost hit the car in front. All the pee pressure was replaced by some other kind of pressure. She gently brushed her fingers on my instant boner in my pant. “I did not ask you to get hard. I said do HARDER!”. When my drool fell on my shirt, she burst into laughter. “It’s so easy to get you horny!” She was red faced. No amount of covering up was going to take away the fact that she touched my dick.

“You have so many layers Sobhita.. I am”, I took a deep breath. “I am excited to explore more.”

“I look forward to it.” Suddenly a nasty pothole sent her bladder quaking. She pursed her lips and closed her eyes shut. Her nails dug into her thighs as she tried to absorb the wave. The rapid hold was catching up with her, rather worse than she anticipated. But she was in no mood to give up. “What I meant was.. You need to make it more d-difficult for me. This is too-too easy” I couldn’t believe what I heard. She stuttered – for the FIRST TIME EVER. This was an uncharted territory. A current of excitement ran through my body. I clenched my dick trying to plot my next move to break her.

As we entered the humongous shopping mall, an idea struck me. “Let’s go to the gaming arcade Sobhita, instead of the movie.” I proposed.

“What? Why?”, I could sense her hesitation.

“Is there any problem Sobhita? Or is the rapid hold catching up with you?”, I teased her.

“Oh, please Rex! I practically held more than this when I was in school. I will manage…”

“So, you do admit that you’re under pressure… that’s disappointing. I thought you would say ‘YOU FEEL NOTHING’”. I was trying to get on her nerves - despite the risk of rupturing my own bladder and our equation.

“No… that’s not what I meant Rex”, she bit her tongue.

“Too late… I know your secret now. Get ready to be PUSHED!”

The next few hours were absolute chaos. I bought the ultra-pass for both of us, which had unlimited games, unlimited food, and most importantly unlimited cold-drink refills. The premise was simple - we compete in the games, whoever lost had to chug the entire large cold-drink. Unfortunately for us, each of the game required us to move continuously. First it was the dance battle, followed by water gun, then those dashing cars, then came bowling. The worst of all was the sports bike simulator. As I helped her sit on the bike, I saw her bladder literally swell. The bulge shifted from her lower belly to the north of her navel. It was like a balloon being blown up. She held her breath and grabbed the handle so tightly that she could have bent it. Even lifting her feet to place on the foot-pegs, made her legs shuddered.

She desperately tried to find space to wiggle her butt but there was none. Her bladder resembled a fully blown water balloon being squeezed in hands. The simulator seemed to shoot up her desperation exponentially. Before the simulator, she could, at least, still sit or walk normally but now she was red faced and visibly in pain. I was no better than her. Our clothes were sticky with sweat and the weight of our bladders were pulling us down. My concentration was faltering, and I had to do Kegels continuously even during the game. The violent vibrations of the bike were killing us both. I could hear her whimper as she tried to maneuver the bike. After a gruesome half an hour, I defeated her in the race.

It was a herculean task to get off the bike myself but then I looked at Sobhita. Her head hung low, and face obscured with hair. She was panting and her legs were squeezing the bike. When I asked her to get off it took a minute or two for her to register my words. She asked me to help her down. Her bladder brushed off against my chest. IT WAS ROCK SOLID! Once alight she hurriedly walked towards the table and took a seat. Her eyes fell on the cold drink, and she immediately chugged it down. It was the sexiest thing that I had ever seen. I glanced at the empty mugs and tried to tally the count. We were almost at par with each other, but I failed to calculate the volume.

“Rex.. Pl-please help me to strap me in my heels. I can’t bend over.” Her voice was shaky. As I forced myself to crouch to tie her heels, I felt my dick literally swell up. The pee inside my body had no place to go. Every movement simply kept hammering my sphincter. I held my breath as I tied the straps of her heels while the other leg kept bobbing. She tightly grabbed the arm rests, and her face was towards the ceiling with the eyes forced close. She was breathing swallow - inhaling and exhaling through her mouth.

“Sobhita, are you ok?” I was concerned, especially after looking at the size of her bladder. It seemed bigger than the last time she was at my home. I didn’t want her bladder to get ruptured. “I..I am fine, really. It’s OK!” Her body language betrayed her words though. After we excited the bowling arena she asked, “Are we going home now?” I looked at the clock – it was 9 in the evening. 21 hours since my last pee and 14 hours for her. Though the amount that we drank was ungodly.

The insides of my Bladder felt as if it contained molten lava. I glanced at her midriff. Her washboard flat abs were replaced by a pregnant like belly. The buttons, the zip and the seams were splitting. Every few steps she kept stopping in her tracks pretending to read the info board kept next to each of the games. She was fighting her bladder with everything she had. But she still managed not to shove her hand in her crotch or unbutton her jeans. Just then my eyes feel on the newly built VR arena. “Will you be able to manage another game, Sobhita? I don’t want you to give up so soon?” I pressed on. “Of course, I can handle it. I can still control myself for a very long time.” She asserted with a strained voice.

Soon we found ourselves midst the VR prep room. The attendants pulled and rugged me into the VR wear, which consists of a vest and a belt full of sensors. They tightened the buckles ruthlessly. When it came to Sobhita, they refused to buckle her up. “We are sorry ma’am, but we don’t allow pregnant women to enter the arena.” She pursed her lips and tried to suck her belly in - but it was a futile attempt. In the end she came up with an excuse, “I am not pregnant...I am just b-bloated.”

It took quite some convincing before she buckled in. Her face was red, and forehead wrinkled but she didn’t utter a single whimper throughout the ordeal. By the end of it the belt almost flattened her bladder bulge. Strands of hair clung to her forehead, and she became even quieter, as if conserving her energy too direct towards her sphincter. I could see frustration on her face as the attendants explained the Do’s and Don’ts of the game. She leaned against the wall for support, her legs refusing to stay still. One moment she would be fanning her legs and the next moment she would stand with her legs crossed. She tried to fiddle with the belt only to pull it tighter. She shrieked but the attendants ignored her.

A few minutes later we were given the VR headsets and infrared guns. “C’mon C’mon get started already!” Sobhita muttered under her voice. Once inside the game we were thrown into a pool of robots attacking us from all the directions. Each time we were hit, the vest and belt vibrated with great intensity. I was not able to cope very well. I could feel my pee right at the tip of my dick. While on the other hand, Sobhita stood with her legs glued together and somehow still shooting the robots. After a particularly damaging hit she yelled, “Why didn’t anyone tell me that these things vibrate like an earthquake!” As I turned towards her, I was blown by a robot, and I died in the game. I took off my VR headset and I was escorted back to the waiting area and watched her gameplay on the screen. Watching her was a treat to my eyes. She crouched on the ground and sat on her knees. Her body rocked back and forth. I couldn’t differentiate whether the robots made her panic or her inflated bladder.

Just then Sobhita’s mobile vibrated. It was a message from Nihita. I found myself salivating at that. What Sobhita didn’t know was that I had inadvertently noticed the pattern to open the screen lock of her mobile. I felt bad but I simply couldn’t resist what she was talking about.

&&&&

All the ball bursting desperation was suddenly replaced by a raging turn-on. I glanced at the game-time and there was still 30 minutes of gameplay left. I took a deep breath and quickly dialled Nihita, hoping that she too would have unblocked me. As soon as the call connected she answered it.. She couldn’t stop gushing about how Sobhita insisted that she blocked me everywhere and how she still believed in me. It made me happy and even listening to the unheard story.

“Listen Nihita!” I began, “I know the little secret of yours.”

“You READ our chat! Gosh, you’re HOT!” She giggled. “I was actually trying a 48 hour hold for the first time and by the time it was hour 40, I couldn’t stop leaking. Though I continued to fight in the same wet thong all night and somehow made it till 48, the thong was destroyed!”

“But how did it make way to my laundry basket!” I curiously asked.

“I will tell you a little secret! You see, I and Sobu have a pact. Whenever we try something for the first time, we fail big time – LIKE ALWAYS! But, if one gives up the challenge, the other one discloses it to Mom and Dad till they berate us like no tomorrow. However, if one struggles and still puts up a fight, the other one has to protect.” Her words were driving me crazy. I could cum buckets before any pee came out. She continued talking. “By the time 48 hours were over, it was the morning when she had her flight.

All 4 of us were just stepping out to drop her at the airport, while I was still unrelieved. As soon as Mom and Dad, got of the porch and headed toward the car, I lost it. Hot gurgling piss came out like a waterfall drenching my leggings. Fortunately, I was wearing a salwar. I mouthed to Sobu, who immediately jumped into action, unlocked the door, and pulled me in. She quickly pulled out another legging from her bag and gave it to me while I tore open my leggings and those soggy undies. Without a second thought she shoved them in her bag, and we hurriedly left for airport. Had she not done it, my parents would have disowned me!”

“That sounded like a dream come true!” I managed to stutter. It was a lot to process and there was barely any time left for the gameplay to end. While I had so many questions to ask, I had to be quick, “Nihita, I am curious though. You said, you guys always failed at the first attempt. Why is that so?”

“It’s always been like that. Our parents trained us hard, to make sure we were always stay under control. They put us into a strict bathroom routine, organized holding challenges every month and what not! Somehow mine and her bladder got trained to hold to extremes but in a controlled condition. When we try something new, we don’t know what to expect, any kind of ‘Control’ or ‘Calculation’ is out of the window. Mark my words, it is going to be one hell of a night for Sobu. Enjoy it while you can because such occurrences are rare!” I could sense her grinning at the prospect. Soon I saw Sobhita taking off her gaming equipment’s. I hurriedly bade Nihita adieu and went to Sobhita, loaded with crucial information.

Jailed for Redemption After exiting the game zone, we struggled our way through dinner. The restaurant was about to close and all they could offer us was a large curry dish, rotis and some cold lassi. It was midnight. I had been containing our pent-up pee 24 hours and she at 17 hours. “Oh my God, this is getting really bad,” I cursed myself as the lassi hit my bladder. Sobhita was too engrossed in her battle to even register it. I could see herself pushing her arms on the table.

It was a valiant fight to not shove her hands between her legs. We kept shuffling in our seats when I got the idea of getting her ice-cream too, knowing fully well, she would not anticipate it. I saw her flinch as the large double sundae was kept on the table. We both gulped nervously and finished the entire tub with an ever-increasing frequency, but there was no mention from either of us about giving up. We were supposed to hold it in and act like adults and we continued to do so. As we exited from the restaurant and headed towards the parking, I asked her, “How much do you normally drink in a day Sobhita?”. I saw her bite her lips before she opened her mouth.

At first nothing came out and then I heard her say with a faint voice, “3 to 3.5 litres”. “Do you know how much we drank today? Just take a guess” I continued as we moved out of the restaurant and sped off. Her blistering need to pee could not be overstated. Her eyes moved rapidly. Her nails dug into my arms as she needed support to walk properly. In fact, she was actually pulling me more and more to walk slowly. And my question definitely added to her woes. “2 litres at home, then 6 lemonades, 3 or 4 cups of tea...”, she paused in her tracks pretending to fiddle with her phone. She shoved her hand in the pocket of her jeans, which now looked as if they were painted on. “I don’t know how many drinks we had at the game zone.. May be 4 or 6 or 8 and then these 2 lassis. I LOST COUNT!” Her eyes suddenly grew wide in horror and looked down at her grotesquely bulging bladder. I felt so happy that I could get her seemingly close to her breaking “Would you now say I pushed you ‘HARD’?”

Before she could answer though, we ran through some barricades on the road. There were a few cops standing who asked to stop the car. Before we knew we were pulled out of the car, our keys confiscated, and we were shoved in a police car. Half an hour later, we were thrown into a lockup. Our overfilled bladders threatened to explode and now we had to find strength to hold it in for an unknown amount of time. Something which we were not prepared for.

Time slowed down and our kidneys speeded up. The lockup was freezing and had nothing to sit on. With so many unknown variables I found myself getting frantic. If I stopped clenching a disaster was imminent. She was no better. Her lips trembled and nose was red, just like when we were at the car dealership. I quickly gave my jacket to her. She hurriedly accepted it and nestled in my arms. We curled up on one corner of the cell. I could hear her yelp and moans every few minutes.

She was struggling to keep still. “I think you should unbutton your jeans Sobhita – your bladder needs room to expand.” She nodded her head conveying her disagreement. But I insisted. “No, Rex I am fine. I c-can easily hold it. My Bladder needs to cope with it.” In spite of that dire situation, she refused to take give her bladder even the slightest of advantage. “Are you sure?” I asked her. “I am raised that way, Rex.” She remained resolute. I admired her strength and steeled myself for a long night of maddening desperation.

Despite our repeated hues and cries we were not allowed to call anyone. All we were told that we resembled a couple who had recently eloped, and that the girl’s father was looking for them. We tried our best to convince the on-duty officers, but they turned deaf ears to it. We spent the next 9 hours in the cell. Each tick of the clock felt like a hammer on my bladder. My entire life was now condensed to one single point – my bladder threatening to explode. She kept pacing in the cell, her hands still away from her crotch. She was just millimetres away from breaking into a full blown pee dance. Her thighs were essentially glued together, with both hands clutching at her legs. Sometimes she would bend over and slowly crouch taking the support of the wall. Those were the nastiest of the waves, I assumed. But she was resolute, through and through. Every time I asked her how she was coping, I was returned with answers like,

“I – I don’t feel anything!”

“No pressure I can’t handle..”

“I am a lady Rex! I will decide if I have to go, not my b-bladder. Even if we reached home, I would go to the bed unrelieved”.

This time however, she had to stop pacing. Her face was got even more contorted, the vein on her forehead was throbbing and her knuckles went white as she grabbed the sides of her thighs. One of her nails chipped off in the process. I heard her groan uncharacteristically. For a moment I felt that the dam would burst open any moment. But nothing happened. After a few minutes of staying in that contorted position motionless, she suddenly stood straight and parted her legs. I could see her bite her lips to the extent that it started bleeding. Her face was blue, and body wet with perspiration. But somehow she remained straight and kept her legs parted. It was monumental to see her fight. “How – how did you do that?” She was still panting but nevertheless she attempted to speak,

“My bladder was being an asshole, so I just put it in place. I won’t such a weakness again. I am so sorry – You won’t see me like this ever again! Promise” She struggled to frame each sentence.

Morning crept in like a silent saviour and our bladders could be mistaken for footballs. The main station officer, a stern-looking man with an air of authority, arrived to our rescue. He informed us that it was time to make our phone call, a chance to summon legal assistance. As Sobhita and I approached the phone, our eyes met, mirroring our shared relief and our unwavering determination to not let our bladder’s win. With shaking fingers, Sobhita dialled a number, her voice trembling as she spoke. "Rex, I hope you don't mind if I make the call," she said, her eyes filled with gratitude for taking this bold step. I nodded in agreement, whispering back.

Soon she was speaking to someone over the phone, and then, after a few hushed words, the conversation turned into a frantic discussion. It was clear that Sobhita was trying to pacify the person on the other side. A few minutes later, she hung up the phone, her eyes filled with a mixture of relief and trepidation. "Rex," she said, her voice quavering, "I've called someone who can help us." I frowned; my curiosity piqued. "Who did you call?" She hesitated for a moment, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Sobhita had dialled my mom's number. I couldn't help but feel a rush of gratitude and embarrassment all at once. The last time I met mom I let her down by admitting that I sniffed Sobhita’s undies and now her son, was at It again. This time in a lockup with the same girl.

My mom arrived at the police station shortly thereafter. I don’t know how she managed, but she bailed us out in no time. When we waddled out of the lockup I had to bear the wrath of mom’s anger. She was furious for having subjected Sobhita to a lockup. I tried as best as I could to speak but neither her incessant scolds nor my bursting bladder would let me speak. Only when Sobhita pitched in I got saved.

“Aunty – Rex was here with me all the time and kept me safe. And he had also been very disciplined, even more than me.” She stood with her body arched forward and occasional shudders. My mom looked at me with contempt and took Sobhita along her. “I don’t care about him. I only want to know if you are OK beta. Do you want to use the bathroom?”

“N-NO Not at all Aunty. In fact, Rex is holding it with me, and he has promised to hold as long as I ask him to.” My mom stopped in her tracks. “Is it?” Sobhita desperately nodded saying ‘Yes’.

“We will see” My mom sternly said and sped off with Sobhita. I stood in front of the police station with no clue what to make of this conversation. I had a bladder which was screaming for mercy holding pee worth 36 hours. To add to my woes, all my hopes of finally getting to pee were dashed with Sobhita’s words.

It was truly the most difficult test of mine - I didn’t know what was going to break first - my bladder or my determination.

The Invitation

After the dreaded night I dragged myself to my rusty apartment. My eyes had turned yellow, I swear, such was the pressure. But I resisted relieving myself till I got any news from Sobhita. The entire day light passed, and I was crawling the wall by the evening. Finally, around 9 or so, Nihita’s text dropped in.

“WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY SISTER! YOU BROKE HER!”

I had my heart and my bladder, both, throbbing in my mouth. I quickly called her and listened her answer in a hushed tone. “Why are you whispering?

“If Sobu sees that I am talking to you, she will kill me.”

“Then TELL ME what happened, Nihita, my dick is going exploding here!” All of this sudden commotion was shooting electric pangs to the top of my dick. “ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU’RE STILL HOLDING?” Nihita nearly screamed with excitement. “I am Polygamous from this moment!” Had it been any other time, I would have ejaculated like a volcano, but I couldn’t muster to say anything more but “I – I am always ready”.

She giggled and continued, “So Sobu unexpectedly came home afternoon on the Vande-Bharat train. I had never seen her like that! Eyes red, dishevelled hair, sweaty odour, and an obscenely bulging bladder. Had a butterfly landed on her bulge at that moment, she would have burst. When Mom and Dad questioned her disgraceful behaviour she narrated the entire incident to them. They simply listened to it and went to their room, with the keys to the only bathroom of the house. She was shuddering like no tomorrow, and you wouldn’t believe what I saw after!”

“Why what happened? Is she OK?. I know she will die before having an accident – SO TELL ME!” I yelled at her as I felt the first drop almost slip out of my dick.

“Let there be some suspense handsome, all I can give you is a little pic to imagine what happened.” I received a pic of a tiny thong with a coin sized wet spot on it. “Is it Sobhita’s? Did she leak? Is she still holding? Tell me FOR GOD SAKE!”

“Keep imagining Tiger! By the way, Mom just conveyed to me that you are invited to our place next Friday! See you soon.” Before I could respond she hung up on me leaving me with a dick as hard as steel rod. Since I didn’t know if Sobhita peed or not, I fought valiantly with my bladder and continued to hold. Around 11pm in the night, 47 hours since my last break my bladder started shooting sharp unbearable pangs through my body. None of my pants could accommodate the bulge. My skin was burning. I was curled up on the floor with my hands shoved in my crotch and finally a hot jet of piss escaped the clutches of my tired sphincter. I grabbed my dick tighter and hurriedly texted Sobhita to check if she were still holding. Instead, she replied to me with a question whether I was still going on. When I replied affirmative, all I got was:

“I am impressed Rex. You came very close to me.”

“What does that mean?” I was climbing the walls and here she was throwing riddles at me.

“Arrive THIS FULL when you come home on Friday, and you will know.” With this she abruptly ended the call.

And that was it. The clock struck 12. I completed 2 full days without a pee, having drunk double the amount of my normal intake. I crawled to the bathroom. My swollen dick failed to stop the disaster. As soon as I opened the lid of the WC, a gusher simply exploded. I took support of the wall with one hand and directed my ferocious manhood to the WC. It was one of those rare occasions when I was hard and yet peeing a half inch thick stream of piss. I used to think only females could let out such torrents, but I was wrong. That firehose like gusher was a sensory overload for me. Every time my body shuddered I realized I came simultaneously. Sweat dripped from every inch oy my body. I could feel my bladder contracting from within, leaving me gasping for air.

For the next minute and a half, I could not even breathe. My brain just directed all my energy towards pushing out the steaming gallon of pee out of my bladder and mind-bending orgasms. It was like my body was rewarding itself for holding so much. The stream was endless and soon enough the closet was full to the brim. I panicked. If the owner found out that I peed on the bathroom floor she would kill me.

I grunted out loud and clamped down my urethra. I applied so much force to shut the opening that would prevent even a bullet from entering. I collapsed on the floor as my bladder angrily revolted with spasm and strong waves of pain. My bladder was still sticking out considerably, but I literally had nowhere to pee. I had to be the man that Sobhita wanted me to be even though I was still frantic. My bladder was still 60% full or so it seemed looking at the bulge. I waddled out of the bathroom hoping that the WC would clear itself. Only to find that the piss level had only sunk a little, perhaps it got clogged somehow.

The Home Coming Thanks to the clogged WC, I forced myself to sustain the rest of the week mostly on partial pees. The bulge on my bladder stayed constant much to my likening. Thursday morning Sobhita called me, “Rex, when you arrive tomorrow, there are going to be discussions with my parents. I am trying my best to tilt them to your side. But I cannot do it without you”.

“Anything! Go ahead!”

“Remember our situation in the lockup the other night? Can you be THAT FULL when you reach? I found really impressive, and it was so manly of you to put up such a great hold!”

“Consider it done!” I replied as my chest swelled with pride. Just then I heard Nihita’s faint voice from the back. “Sobu! You filled the WC to the brim again! PLEASE STOP IT!” I had an ear-to-ear grin on my face and immediately teased Sobhita, “Ahem! I am assuming that this is going to be a test only for me?”

“You cannot be more wrong! Me not holding can happen only on one condition” I could almost see her flaring her nostrils.

“And what’s that?”, I curiously asked. “The only time when I will not be holding will be when I am dead or maybe I will die with a full bladder too!” She sternly replied. Her words reverberated in my ears and her dedication towards this lifestyle was instantly etched in my mind. After I hung up the phone, I looked at the clock. It was 7AM. My bladder was pulsating and begging for relief, but I relished it none the less. With great reluctance I decided to take a full pee. It was supposed to be my last one till I returned from her place. BUT BUT BUT, the clogged WC meant I was able to relieve myself only partially. On other days, I would have enjoyed it but this time I actually needed a full relief. L

Following that pee, I got a text from Sobhita. “You know what Rex, why don’t you decide my intake for the day? I didn’t want to have the slightest advantage and you’re the best person who can push me. Though I will fully expect you to drink the same nonetheless.”

“You read my mind!”, I replied faster than light reply and made sure to keep her phone buzzing all day:

“2 litres immediately & 500ml after breakfast”, “Why don’t you get a coconut water?”, “Hydration is important – grab 500ml now!’, “A tall lassi with lunch”, “Down another litre before the gym!”, “Time for tea”, “An extra glass before dinner”, “One glass after dinner”, “Milk before bed is a healthy habit.” I was trying to break Sobhita again, but she left me dumbfounded. Late in the evening, when I texted to check on her, she responded with a series of clips she took all day as she chugged every single one of my challenges plus a few more. Then she called me at once.

“Hi Rex. Did you see the pics? I drank all of it, just like you prescribed and a few more glasses too.” My eyes nearly popped out in horror.

“Why the extra glasses?”

“Because of you Rex! You got me tremendously full, and it felt so good that I thought to challenge myself even more!” She was grinning. I could feel it.

“Tremendous you say? You are going to still hold it right?” I nervously asked.

“Of course, Rex. I appreciate how you kept the intake well-paced and yet heavy. But I think I can still last for a day and a half AT LEAST!” She was satisfied to say the least. “DUDE! STOP! She is making me do the same. It’s like I am drinking an entire swimming pool!” Nihita screamed from background.

The next day I arrived with a stabbing pain plaguing my lower back and a bladder that could shame a football. I knowingly chose a cargo pant and briefs which kept my manhood and dick squeezed like a vice and enhanced my bulge. Sobhita and Nihita, both came to receive me. The latter was dressed in a tight pink jean and a crop top. The ensemble was more for skin show, I feasted my eyes on her massive under-boobs, her chiseled mid-riff, and her solid bladder bulge. Sweat filled her face and body never still for a minute. Sobhita on the other hand, was sporting a considerably bigger bulge than Nihita.

Her salwar seemed painted on her body and the fabric was stretched tightly across her bladder. It put Nihita’s bladder to shame. But Sobhita stood absolutely still. Except her forehead being slightly sweaty, she showed no other signs of holding a tank inside. As I approached them, I noticed both of them looking at my crotch. While Nihita stared at it with her mouth gaped open, Sobhita pursed her lips to suppress her smile. She hugged me tightly which seemed more like to gauge how full my bladder was. We both were hard, if not concrete hard. Once she gauged it, she decided to hold me for a bit longer actually soaking in the warmth of my jacket. After a while she gave me an approving look. I knowingly smiled at her but at the back of my mind I was praying to my starts to give me strength to hold through.

After a whimpering drive by Nihita, we reached their place. The moment I stepped inside I received a rude shock. Along with her parents, my mom and dad too were there, having brunch. My eyes widened in horror, but Mom signalled me to sit beside her. As their traditions dictated we were served a hearty brunch with fresh fruit juice. Sobhita’s mom gave us a glass each. It was like staring at death but there was yet more to come. She snatched an entire jug from her mother.

“Beta, dont get carried away. You should not drink all of that at once. You are not you . . .” her mother warned but Sobhita fiercely interrupted.

“Mom, I have Rex’s support. I can easily finish it. In fact, Rex will finish a jug as well.” What was she trying to do, drown me in my own piss, I thought to myself. “Do not waste a single drop Rex. I would expect you to be strong at least once in your life” My mother warned me as well. I gulped down my throat looking at the new jug in front and then towards Sobhita, who looked at me with expecting eyes. She smiled and pointed me to the jug. Throughout the brunch, I watched Sobhita in awe as she downed the entire jug like it was a spoonful. Just a week ago Sobhita struggled to sit still on Day 1 of rapid hold. And now, she had mastered it already.

Brunch with a Challenge After brunch, Sobhita announced, “Rex, you may be surprised to see your parents here. But truth be told, we had always been close to your parents. Everyone at the table except me and Nihita dislikes you but I want to prove to them that they are mistaken.” She then turned to her parents and continued, “Yesterday you kept asking me the whole day Mom, that I was overestimating my strength. Yet I stand straight in front of you.” Well, she was not exactly standing straight, but gently shifting her weight from one foot to the other. “Rex, encouraged me to do it because he himself could do it too.”

Suddenly all eyes were on me. She kept on going. Small beads of sweat dropped from her forehead and cheeks. Her fists remained tightly clenched and she chugged the remainder of the juice. “Today with Rex, I will prepare everything needed for the Puja tomorrow. I will decide how much we are going to consume today and even when the Puja gets over tomorrow, we will be standing strong.”

The parents excused themselves for the table. Nihita looked at us with tears in her eyes. Her face Das nearly blue now and the veins on her forehead could be counted. She was hanging by a thread. “I… I am not sure if I will last that long Sobu.” Sobhita was furious at her and passed on another glass to her. “No, you said you wanted him too so…” My ears picked up her words like an antenna. But before Nihita could respond our parents arrived. They announced, “We respect your sentiments, Rex and Sobhita. If you want this marriage to happen, you two need to demonstrate your strengths till the ‘Puja’ tomorrow is taken care of. If any of you give up, this marriage won’t happen.” Sobhita eagerly nodded and so did I. The horror in Nihita’s eyes was pitiable.

Once away from the table, we started off the day, I asked Sobhita, “Why didn’t you tell me that my parents would be here too?”

“Rex, you taught me that nothing can be under our control but our bladders. So, let’s cork ourselves up and fight together.” With that she threw me the keys to the car. The sun hung high in the sky as we drove off to the market nearby. After an hour of excruciating drive through pot-filled roads and slow traffic, Sobhita took us to a juice centre. On the top of her list was the local delight sugarcane juice. Soon three tall glasses were handed to us. Before chugging the juice, I saw Sobhita pause for a second. Her lips were slightly parted. She slowly rolled her eyes to the left trying to remember something. I don’t know what took over her she kept her glass aside and took out her phone flipping through her gallery.

“Woah! That’s a lot”, she whispered to herself while noting something in her phone. Then, without a second thought she began drinking the juice. I followed suit. With every gulp, the burning sensation at the tip of my dick increased. I asked Sobhita how she was holding up. “Honestly, it feels like I am holding a barrel inside me. But I want to hold more.” She chugged the rest of the juice and asked for a refill for both of us. When the second glass arrived, she paused again and then at one go, she finished it. I did the same when she nudged me to down them all. Once I was done, she cleared the bill to the vendor. At that moment I noticed that her legs were firmly crossed, and she stood with folded arms – breathing in and out of her mouth. Indeed, the liquid was catching up with her, FAST,

Nihita on the other hand looked like a human pinball. She could not sit or stand still. From the moment we arrived she had been panting and puffing. Her concentration was broken. All she knew was she had to get rid of the juice, so she dim-wittingly tried to throw the juice away. Sobhita though caught her in the act and forced the glass to her lips. Poor Nihita had to drink all of it but not without drama. Her body was shuddering, her face scrunched up and legs fervently jogging at the place. As soon as the glass was emptied, she brazenly shoved her hand in her crotch and squirmed around. The onlookers laughed at her. Sobhita tried to pull Nihita to stand straight and drag her to the car. In the process of this silly cat fight, Nihita accidentally poked Sobhita’s bladder. “Have you been drinking concrete or what!” Sobhita was not in a condition to answer.

The blow on her stomach was severe enough that she lost balance. Her face was red like a tomato, and she had to lean on Nihita for support. Everyone had a limit and Sobhita was not immune to it. Looking at her go all shudder-y and gasping for breath, I thought that her dam was about to burst.

“Sobu, are you OK, should we turn back?”, Nihita desperately asked, hoping it to be a yes for her own selfish reasons. Sobhita was engrossed in her own battle to care to reply. Her toes were tightly curled but her hands remained firmly on her thighs, miraculously. She gently rocked back and forth trying to prevent her bladder from revolting. Nihita nudged her again but this time I jumped in, “NO. Just a little blow cannot break her. She is going to hold it, isn’t it Sobhita?” I threw in a hint of challenge. Sobhita heard my words and vigorously nodded. A minute or two later, she steeled herself, “He is right, Nihu. Now, watch and learn.” She took a deep breath and stood up with a swift motion as if nothing happened.

After that little fiasco, we hobbled to the supermarket. Sobhita had the laundry list of things to get whereas I and Nihita followed her through the store to get the stuff. In the aisles, Nihita unbuttoned her unforgiving jeans. Her bladder ballooned immediately. She pulled the jeans so low that I could see the exact structure of her pelvis, her hip bones, her yellow sweat-stained thong. Most importantly beneath her absolutely chiselled torso her bladder looked as if it was bolted on.

“Please don’t tell her.” Nihita pleaded to me. I assured her that I wouldn’t because I was in the same boat as hers. My balls were aching with every step. My back felt as if I was hit with baseball bat. Nihita was confused, “I don’t understand. Other than the size of your bladder, you don’t even look desperate.” I sheepishly nodded. From the corner of my eyes, I kept a watch on Sobhita, who walked slightly ahead of us. As we inched through the aisles, I asked Nihita, “I am curious though, why did you compare her bladder to concrete?” I could see a glint of jealousy in her voice, “Because it was THAT HARD! Her training is paying her off.”

“Training, why would she need training?”

“Because of that little coin sized spot on her thong…” We were so engrossed in the conversation that we failed to notice Sobhita glaring at us. “NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THAT AGAIN!” She yelled at both of us. Nihita tried to pacify Sobhita, “Sobu, it’s okay! I am not judging you. He knows about the wet thong in laundry story too!” Things were quickly escalating. I pitched in, “Sobhita, it is not a big deal. Let it go” I saw tears brimming in her eyes.

“No, it is a big deal for me. It was the only drop that escaped my control in the last 22 years. I was fully under control when I reached home that day. Thanks to your mom who got me the tickets at the last minute. I narrated the entire incident to Mom and Dad and all they did was to humiliate me because I couldn’t stand still. Even after withstanding the entire ordeal and drinking more than I normally would they were not satisfied. They made me hold till it was time for bed. At that point, I decided to change into something more comfortable. But the jeans were cutting my bladder into two. When I tried to forcefully pull it down, I lost a drop into my thong.”

I listened to each of her word intently and asked, “Why were they not satisfied?”

“Because they wanted me to be as strong as brother after he cut ties with us. But I was never good enough. Throughout our childhood, dad pitted him and me into holding competitions with new challenges. He beat me every time. I on the other hand simply couldn’t adopt fast enough and lost. I had never seen go to the bathroom let alone be desperate.

“Where is he now?”, I asked.

“They cut ties with him because he married a girl who was not strong like him. But even though they don’t talk to him they keep comparing me with him. I want to show them that I am just as strong as my brother. Nihita is crazy after you too. I know everything and I don’t mind it. All I want is to be the strongest holding machine and have a life-partner who respects me and is equally strong. YOU FIT THE DESCRIPTION!” It was a lot of info to digest in such a short time and that too with a bladder so close to betray me. I couldn’t fathom that out there was a guy who was supposedly even stronger than Sobhita, let alone me.

In her quest to prove her strength, we spent the rest of our errand tanking up at every opportunity. At the fruit shop, we downed the tallest available fruit juices. Then at the sweet shop we got some syrupy sweets. Once we reached back, it was like a water fest. I and she had something to drink in front of us – all the time. The amount of liquid that I drank at her place could nearly for three average guys.

The Long Night After dinner when everyone went up to their rooms, I had some privacy for the first time in the day. For some reason, the parents felt that I deserved to sleep on the couch in the cold. I could feel steam blowing out of my ears. The skin over my bladder was inflamed. My bladder was getting severe cramps and legs felt numb. The weight was too much to carry around, and I was pretty sure I could fill up a barrel too. I didn’t care if it was biologically possible.

Thankfully I brought joggers for the night. It accommodated the grotesque bulge and hid my briefs which could tear apart any second. It was still eerily early, and I was pacing in the hall with a hand clutching my manhood trying to subdue my pain. I don’t I know but I had a gut feeling that even Sobhita was unable to fall asleep. I picked up my phone and texted her. Much to my surprise she quickly responded. When I asked why, she simply said, “Let me come to you”. Before I could write back I saw a heavenly figure, tip toe down from the stairs. It was my darling Sobhita. Her boobs heaved under the loose t-shirt; she wore to bed perhaps.

&&

Her graceful gait was now a mix of hurry and restraint. She grabbed the railing with one hand and kept the other hand at the waist while getting down from the staircase. Any outsider would mistake her for a pregnant lady in her second trimester. When I asked her about it, she seemed to be lost for words and simply signalled me to wait until she poured us both a glass of water. The sound of water pouring in the glass made us both wince and squirm. More than the ticking time bomb in her bladder she was worried about us ‘NOT DRINKING ENOUGH’. I reminded myself that I was not supposed to show any weakness in front of this goddess. As soon as she handed over the glass, I chugged it down. She smiled to be, beaming with pride and then finished the glass.

She pulled her oversized T-Shirt up, tantalizingly slow and threw it aside. Time froze at that instant, and I was presented with a sight that I would never forget. She revealed with a bladder that defied all laws of physics. I had seen countless morphs of bloated bladder, but this was real. A real beach ball sized bladder which was indeed hard like concrete. Her skin was pulled thin and it was red with soreness. It shined with sweat and the thin veins under her skin appeared like rivulets. Self-torture was an understatement. She then took my hand and placed It on the apex of her bladder. It swelled at least an inch above her navel and extended to her crotch. The projection of the apex was at par with her silicone globes. The water which she downed just a few seconds ago, made its way to her bladder almost immediately. I could feel her bladder shudder gently from within.

“I have seen these things in the movies, but I never thought I would display myself like this to anyone” Her voice was feeble but steady. Her legs were un-crossed. Body absolutely still. Hands on her boobs, clutching the bikini top, “But when you texted me, the first thought that came to my mind was, this guy is thinking about me and how Mi might be holding it in.”

“I did”, I was horny and painfully frantic at the same time. I looked at her with vapid eyes.

“Rex, I appreciate you taking so much pain for me. And I just want to tell you that your efforts won’t go in vain.” She then held my hand and slid to her crotch. A painful jolt shot up my confused dick. Was it supposed to ejaculate or push out the pent-up load of pee? I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. “What are you doing?” I asked her with trembling voice.

“Shhh. . .Tell me what do you feel?”

“A tiny piece of fabric, dry?”

“Yes, that’s right. It’s the thong I had been wearing since my last pee and I will continue to wear it till the Puja gets over. And this time there won’t be any wet spots on this.” I was stunned. Where was she drawing all the power to resist the outburst. “Do you not feel anything yet?” I could resist asking her.

“Doesn’t matter how badly it hurts. My bladder’s job is to hold it. And it will hold it . . .As long as I want it to.” She bent over to give me a quick kiss on my cheek. Her warm boobs squished against my boobs and her exotic vanilla perfume mesmerised me. Only I knew how I resisted pulling her into making love.

The Long Day

I woke up the next morning with a pain of a thousand knives stabbed into my bladder. I slowly walked to the bathroom trembling and shuddering. Someone was still inside. There were guests all around looking at me with disgust in their eyes, wondering who is this weakling who cannot wait to enter the bathroom. Only if they knew 48 hours had passed since my last relief and that too partial. I was confident that my nerves leading to my bladder were now permanently damaged.

My sphincter was on fire and dick aching as if was it put into a shredder. Then I heard the sound of the lid being opened and clothes being pulled down, hastily. A second later the entire house filled with the noise of a loud gusher from inside. For a moment I felt somebody had left a tap open directly into the WC. I heard a lady moan. From the torrential noise, I could make it that she had not been to the bathroom in a really long time. Pee rushed to my dick and panic clouded my mind. Was it Sobhita? Why was she peeing all of a sudden? I was about to knock the door but just then someone pulled me from behind. It was Sobhita. She hurriedly pulled me to the outhouse which had a spare bathroom.

Her face was red, and it appeared she was trying to hold her breath. I asked her who was in the bathroom, “N- Nihita” She barely managed to push the words out of her mouth. It was more of a whisper. It was at that moment when I noticed her attire. She looked smoking hot, a red saree draped so low that it could barely cover her modesty. Her blouse was cut so low that it could barely qualify for as bikini top, let alone blouse. But most importantly her chiselled flat midriff was gone. She looked pregnant – ABSOLUTE PREGNANT! The bulge pushed the seams of the saree so low, that I could see the bands of her thongs peeping out. It was painfully obscene, and no one could turn a blind eye to that. Pain was etched on her face. I felt puny looking at her struggles.

“Are you going to be ok?” I was genuinely worried. “Sobhita, you are hurting yourself. You don’t have to do this. We can elope.”

&&

She angrily looked at me and said something I will never forget, “My bladder won’t d-decide my fate. I.. Will n-not pee today or even tomorrow.” She then slowly uncrossed her legs to prove her determination. I couldn’t stop myself anymore and pulled herself to plant a passionate kiss on her lusciously full lips. After a minute of breathless kiss, I got ready, and we proceeded for the puja, holding her hand. I couldn’t see Nihita around until Sobhita signalled to me that her mom asked her to stay indoors because she was impure now. It was noteworthy that despite her strained sweaty face, I could see her blushing.

As we entered the mandap, all eyes were on us. We both stood straight despite our obscene bulges were trying to flirt with gravity. The brows on her face disappeared at once and she pulled off her ‘I am empty’ look. Calm and pleasing. Had it not been for her pregnant piss baby, no one would say that she was holding 2 days’ worth of pee inside her bladder. I was not sure what people made of my bulge but surely I heard a few aunties talk to our parents saying that they have found the most suitable man for their daughter. I beamed with pride. Sobhita on the other handheld her breath and behaved as if the tsunami inside her bladder had subsided. She greeted the guests, performed the rituals with a strained smile on her face, bent down to seek ‘Ashirwad’ (blessings) from the elders. I steeled myself and followed suit too. Every time I did I felt a drop trying to escape.

Any Indian puja needed fasting, and it was no different for us. Throughout the day we were supposed to stand at the puja mandap and participate in the rituals. Even though we were fasting, the priest allowed us to have fruit juices to beat the heat. The entire day went like a blur. Rituals-juice-repeat. BY the time all the guests went and the mandap was cleared Sobhita could not stand any more. Nihita was finally allowed to come out of her room and at once she rushed to Sobhita who sat quietly on the couch trying to be as demure as she could, given her state. I was falling in love with her every time I looked at her. 60 hours and drinks to fill in a small pond resided in her bladder. She couldn’t even utter a word now. “Mom! Look at her, she has proved her point. She and even Rex both showed their strength and character. Have some mercy.”

I held Nihita’s hand. “No, we both don’t need any mercy. We are perfectly capable to control ourselves.” Sobhita turned to me with tears in her eyes and asked me to sit beside her.

Our parents went to a different room and after a long discussion they came out. My Mom began, “With what we saw of Sobhita today, she has proven to possess all the traits of a Goddess. We accept her and want to welcome her into our family.” A huge ear to ear smile formed on my face and hers too. Then we turned our eyes to Sobhita’s mother, “While Rex’s family feels that Sobhita is strong, we still feel she has a lot to improve and be even better disciplined. As far as Rex is concerned, we felt that he was not suitable until today when he proved all of us wrong with his sense of responsibility and discipline. We too want to welcome him in our family.

Nihita jumped with joy until her mother cut her off. “As for you Nihita, you are a disgrace. You dared to void yourself on such an auspicious day. We expected more from you, and we are disappointed that Sobhita did not train you properly enough. Both of you to your room at once.” That was the last of what I saw of Sobhita and Nihita. I was urged by my parents to start return journey home, sans any relief.

I didn’t know what to expect next. As soon as I got into the car, I texted Sobhita, “I love you. I am not going to pee till you decide.”

She immediately responded, “❤️, keep holding for me Rex and I promise to keep my thongs dry like this always.” My phone buzzed again. It was a selfie of her crotch still wearing that tiny white thong, digging into her skin but still absolutely dry. I smiled and gave a tight squeeze to my dick before driving off with my parents.

@Roronoa Zoro

: I am so glad that you read both the parts. I hope the female desperation made up for the male desperation in between. It will take some time for the 3rd part to come out. Waiting to hear from the original patron.
