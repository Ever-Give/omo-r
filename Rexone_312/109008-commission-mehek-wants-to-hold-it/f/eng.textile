Hi Omo Lovers! Presenting to you all yet another commission story. You are going to love Mehek. She is hot, busty and most importantly loves to hold her pee! ;-)

Mehek Wants to Hold it.

The sun was up and so was Mehek. She practically bounced out of her dorm fully dolled up from head to toe. Her black crop top was stretched to its limits trying to contain her perfect silicone boobs. Her cleavage was bursting out of the seams and if she took one deep breath her globes would break free. But there was more. Her pink denim shorts or more like denim panties looked like they were sprayed on. It squeezed her hips and butt cheeks red. It left absolutely nothing to the imagination. And that little whale tail she sported with her tiny undersized black thong was icing on the cake. And lastly came her pink stilettos to complete the look.

Mehek knew she looked hot, and she loved it – the lingering gazes, the little whistles. At 19, she was the most popular girl of her college, and she had a reputation to maintain and a secret thrill to relish. Even this early, she was subtly rocking back and forth, a tiny squeeze in her inner thighs. A playful, almost strained smile played on her lips – trouble was definitely brewing. Palak, her roommate, trailed behind, looking like she’d just rolled out of bed – because she pretty much had. She mumbled into her oversized hoodie and a tight denim jean below, "Do you have to dress like that for a bus?"

Mehek just winked, though her eyes darted down for a split second, a flicker of something unreadable there. “Duh! You never know who I might end up with today" She tossed her hair, but even that felt a little… jerky. Palak just rolled her eyes, so predictable. “Wait for me, I really need to pee!” She tugged Mehek with her.

“Babe! How often do you need to pee?” Mehek yelled mocking angriness as Palak entered the cubicle and started releasing a stream.

“I peed last evening Mehek! Please don’t make a fuss every time I want to pee.”

“It’s ok to not pee every day! GROW UP!” Mehek banged the door as the sound of Palak’s stream made her squirm.

“You do remember there's no bathroom on the bus, right? Like, for hours?”

Mehek's grin stretched a little too wide, a bit too fixed. “Yeah, yeah, I know.”

“You went to the bathroom, right? Right?” Palak flushed and stepped out.

Mehek actually laughed, a little too loud, a bit too forced. “Nah, I’m good. I don’t want to pee today. Besides,” she purred, voice dropping to a playful whisper, “where's the fun in that?” But even as she said it, her legs squeezed together for a split second, a tell-tale sign of her full bladder.

Palak just sighed, head shaking slowly. “Suit yourself, babe. But don’t come crying to me when your bladder threatens to explode. It’s a FOURTEEN-hour journey.” Little did Palak know, the tantrum was already rehearsing.

“I can wait 40 for fucks sake!” Mehek strutted out of the bathroom not wanting Palak to spoil her mood.

The bus engine roared to life, and a wave of excited chatter filled the air – Goa, baby! Mehek practically dove for the window seat, a tiny, sigh of relief escaped her mouth as she plopped on the seat. Her body was grateful to find some relief after sitting. Though she was not exactly relaxed, and her shorts already squeezed her belly inwards. Palak sat down next to her, a knowing smirk playing on her lips. The ride had barely started, and Mehek’s thighs were already squished tightly. But then she shocked Palak by pulling out a water bottle, and brought it to her thick red lips, taking a long, maybe a little too eager gulp.

Palak watched, brow furrowed. “Chugging already? Seriously? Girl, bathroom. Bus. Remember?”

“Relax,” Mehek said, voice a tad too high, smile a little too bright, “I like the rush down there…I’ll be fine.” But she was not fine. Her legs were already crossed at the ankles, and knees bobbed up and down restlessly. Four hours in, and Mehek had already drained two 300ml water bottles. Empty plastic crinkled in her hand and she bit her lips tightly as the road bumps felt more pronounced. She gulped down her throat as her swollen bladder started to rub against her sensitive G-Spot from within and pee rushed to her pee hole. It was a vicious cycle of pleasure and pressure.

BUT. It was not enough. She wanted more. She nudged Palak, biting her lips, “Got… anymore?”

Palak handed over another bottle, eyes narrowed like she was assessing a bomb. “Seriously, Mehek? You look like you're about to burst. And not in a good way.”

Mehek forced a laugh, but it came out strained, breathy. “Bursting? It’s just been 13 hours! Chill babe!” Even as she joked, she squirmed in her seat, the tight denim biting into her swollen pussy, driving her crazy. The fabric pulled taut across her thighs as she crossed her legs tightly, desperately seeking a millisecond of relief that just wasn’t coming.

When the bus finally coughed to a stop at a dusty roadside pit stop, everyone scurried out, obviously bursting. Palak made one last ditch effort, to convince Mehek, “Come on, Mehek, just pee. Please! You look like you’re about to explode… literally!” Mehek shook her head, “Hot girls don’t pee!” But her eyes betrayed her, flicking towards the tiny restroom. One part of her brain said – just go and her pulsating G-spot said – give me more. She double crossed her legs tighter and instead, she bought herself some snacks and another 2-litre water bottle. “It should be enough for a pee-gasm!”

Once they resumed the journey, Mehek was under serious pressure now but that didn’t stop her from enjoying the sensations deep within her vagina. She twisted the cap off the new bottle, and took a slow, deliberate sip, her eyes locking with Palak’s knowing gaze. The waistband of her shorts was digging in with every bump of the road as her bladder swelled further. Seven hours deep into the journey and sixteen hours into the hold, Mehek was now full-on squirming. Her legs were crossed so tight they looked like they might actually fuse together, her body angled awkwardly, desperate for escape. All her shaking and restlessness was causing her boobs to heave more and more. Noticing that Mehek was not paying attention Palak had to shove her boobs into her top, causing the taut fabric to creak. A sheen of sweat starting to appear on her forehead. Palak watched, a mix of concern and amusement warring on her face.

“Having fun, Miss ‘I can always hold it’?” Palak drawled, dripping with sarcasm.

“Shut up,” Mehek mumbled, voice tight and way strained. She shifted again, those denim shorts now feeling like a goddamn vice around her toned thighs.

Palak’s eyes dropped lower, widening just a little. “Oh my god, Mehek. Is that… is that your bladder?” And yeah, it was unmistakable. A definite bulge, round and firm, pressing against the unforgiving denim. Mehek’s cheeks flushed red, hot and fast. She tried to subtly tug her bag further onto her lap – to hide the obvious. "I got this Palak" she snapped, voice a little breathless, a little shaky. Palak smirked, loving this a little too much. "It's literally fighting your zipper! You are bursting Mehek!" The tightness of her shorts just cut into the apex of her bulge, making her desperation obvious to anyone with eyes.

“I. WANT. TO. HOLD. IT. LONGER.” Mehek insisted as her mind was torn between enjoying the pleasure of her throbbing pussy and her aching bladder. But even she was starting to sound less convinced. Palak just shook her head, pure disbelief etched on her face. "You're unreal. Just admit you need to pee! Look at you, you're practically vibrating with it!"

Mehek glared; lips pressed into a thin, pale line. "Never."

Ten hours into the ride and nineteen into the hold. Mehek's legs were clamped together so hard her muscles were actually trembling. She started bouncing her knee, a frantically, like a trapped animal. The denim shorts were digging in painfully, the button started to bruise into her skin. Every jolt of the bus shot a wave of agony through her lower body.

“Mehek,” Palak said, voice low, genuinely worried now. “This is getting… kinda scary.” And Palak wasn't exaggerating.

“I’m fine!” Mehek hissed, but her face was paper white, clammy, breath shallow gasps. The fabric of her crop top was damp where it pressed against her skin, sticking uncomfortably.

“You’re practically crushing that water bottle,” Palak pointed out with panic. Yes that 2-litre water bottle was long gone and now it sloshed in her bladder. "Just give in, Mehek! It's not worth it! Seriously, you’re going to hurt yourself!”

“No!” Mehek said stubbornly, eyes squeezed shut tight, body rigid, a statue of desperate resistance. “I am going to make it to Goa.”

Palak rolled her eyes, but the worry was clear now. "At this point, I think your pee might actually arrive in Goa before we do.” It was only half a joke.

Fourteen hours and twenty-three hours into her hold. The bus finally rumbled into the hotel parking lot. Sweet, blessed relief was almost within reach… but so was utter, humiliating defeat. Her bladder jutted out of her midsection by two inches and she could no longer sit or stand still. Her bladder felt like a bowling ball, straining the denim to its absolute limit. She was hunched over, legs still clamped together, teeth gritted, silent screams trapped inside.

Palak couldn’t help a choked laugh, though real concern laced her voice. “Oh my god, Mehek. You’ve officially turned yourself into a human water balloon! I hope you are not leaking...”

"Shut... up," Mehek gasped, voice barely a whisper, each word a monumental effort.

When the bus doors hissed open, Mehek stood up with excruciating slowness. Her shorts were now digging into her butt cheeks and her thongs looked more like a tattoo on her sweat-drenched skin. Her nipples had started to poke out of her undersized top. Palak reached out a hand to steady her, and in all honesty even turned on looking at her shaking writhing body.

“Go. Now. Before you actually… lose it,” Palak urged, voice firm.

Mehek shook her head slowly, swaying just a hair, eyes glazed, fixed on some distant point in the parking lot. "I'll go… when I'm ready.”

“WHAT! You still don’t want to pee?!” Palak said, throwing her hands up in exasperation, but she kept her arm firmly around Mehek’s shoulders, ready to catch her if she crumpled. As they walked towards the hotel, a tiny, trembling smirk, more grimace than grin, formed on Mehek's lips. It was agony, pure, mind-numbing agony. But a weird sense of triumph flickered through the pain. Only when her twenty-four hours were complete, Mehek stripped down, deliberately slowly and flung her thong to Palak.

“Ewww!” Palak shuffled it away from her face and paused suddenly, “HOW ARE THEY STILL DRY?”

Mehek’s smirk widened, “Like…I…s-said… I can ALWAYS hold it.”
