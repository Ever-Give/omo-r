Hi omo lovers! I finished yet another commission project.

If you love girls who think they can hold it no matter what but overestimate themselves, then you are going to love this one. Share it, comment on it and let me know if you would like me to craft customized stories for you.

Without much further ado, I proudly present to you my new character Negar in the story "Negar Never Needs It."

My First Experience:

My colleagues set me up with Negar through one of our office meetings. From the moment, she opened the door of the meeting room, I was hooked. A seductive fragrance spread through the room before she had even set a foot inside. Then appeared Negar. I gulped down my throat looking at her. She stood straight, with her breasts sticking out of her petite frame by at least half-a-foot. Her caramel brown hair was tightly tied into a ponytail. Her shirt clung to her body without a single crease and her skirt stretched tightly around her bubble butt. There was a small bugle in her abdomen which I imagined to be her bladder, but I quickly brushed that thought aside. She waved at me and took a seat right next to me. “You must be Rex,” she leaned towards me to whisper, giving me an unparalleled view of her tight cleavage. “You must be Negar.” I smiled, “My friends did say that you will be EASY to spot.”

She giggled and casually crossed her shiny legs as the meeting commenced. And thus, it began. The attendant brought in coffee like a godsend. She poured herself a cup and immediately started sipping as if she was dying out of coffee-thirst. The room was filled with the drone of colleagues, the discussion of projects, and yet, despite the rising boredom, she kept drinking coffee—cup after cup, each time lifting the warm liquid to her lips without a second thought.

Two hours and four cups in, I counted. When the meeting finally wrapped up, people were practically sprinting for the bathroom, laughing about how the coffee had done its job. One of the women nearby nudged Negar with a grin, asking if she needed to join them. There was something playful in the air, something casual. But Negar—without a hint of concern, with a smile that sent a spark of intrigue straight through me—waved them off. "I prefer to wait," she said. Wait? Most people would have bolted, but she... she liked to hold it? My omorashi senses picked it up. It was so casual, so confident.

Shortly after we left the meeting room, right past the bathroom doors. Negar didn’t even look at it. At the same time her bulge had slightly grown. “Lunch?” She asked as she finished the remaining water from her bottle. Who was I to say no. As we left the office together, I watched her closely. She moved with an easy grace, as if there wasn’t a full bladder behind her movements, no urgency in her steps. Her tight skirt clung to her hips as she walked beside me, and I kept waiting for her to pause, to glance toward the restrooms as we passed in front of it again. But no. She breezed out the door, leaving me both impressed and... aroused by her nonchalance.

We found a café for lunch, and I half expected her to excuse herself then—finally, to take that much-needed break. But instead, she slid into her seat, ordered a tall, iced tea, and met my eyes with that same calm confidence. I couldn’t help but notice the way her fingers toyed with the rim of the glass, her lips curling into a smile that was both innocent and filled with an unspoken dare. I wasn’t the only one paying attention anymore. She knew I was watching. Her hand, steady and delicate, lifted the glass once again, and she drank, finishing it far too quickly. The server came by and placed the food, offering a refill. I noticed a tiny moment of hesitation. But just as quickly as it appeared, it vanished, replaced with that signature smirk. She accepted. Another tall glass.

We spoke about a lot of things trying to get to know each other as I ogled at her more intently. Beneath the table, her legs shifted—just a little at first. A subtle crossing, then uncrossing, her thighs brushing together in a way that sent a pulse of heat through me. She wasn't fidgeting, not yet, but there was an underlying tension in her movement. Each shift of her hips told me more than words ever could. She was in control, yes, but she was definitely under pressure.

As we finished our lunch, I leaned forward, watching her fingers trace the condensation on her glass. “Negar? Would you like to use the restrooms before we leave?” I asked, my voice deliberately casual, as though I hadn’t been paying attention to every small change in her posture. Negar’s lips curved into that confident smile again, her eyes locking with mine. “Oh no! I can contain my waters,” she said, her voice smooth, almost teasing. She didn’t break eye contact, didn’t waver, but beneath the table, her legs pressed together a little more tightly.

After lunch we wandered through the market, and though she moved with the same cool composure, there was something different now. Her steps were more deliberate, her hips swayed slightly less with each movement, as if she were trying to control the growing pressure inside her. I quickly did a mental math – a litre of water, four small cups of coffee, two tall glasses of iced tea and a glass of water and perhaps an early morning pee. Negar was holding some serious load. Every now and then, she’d pause at a stall, picking up a drink or sampling something, but I noticed how she’d shift from foot to foot when she thought I wasn’t looking. She’d cross her legs at the ankles or shift her weight, those little signs started creeping in. Still, not a word. Not a single mention of her increasing desperation.

The afternoon dragged on, and so did Negar's composure. Her voice was still soft, her laughter still present, but there was a raw edge now. Each movement was calculated—crossing her legs, uncrossing them, finding reasons to stretch, to adjust herself. Her fingers played with the hem of her skirt, occasionally gripping the fabric as though it were the only thing grounding her in the moment. The pressure was mounting, I could see it. And yet... she never faltered. Hours passed, and it was time to head back. Walking toward the car, I noticed the shift in her walk. Her steps had grown stiffer. Her heels seemed to worsen her condition by the minute. Her breaths were quieter as if she were telling herself to calm down and clench harder.

I opened the car door for her, and as she slid into the seat, I caught the subtle arch of her back, the way she adjusted herself, her legs pressed firmly together. As I drove, I looked at her from the corner of my eyes, watching the way her fingers gripped the edge of her seat, her thighs squeezed together just a little too tightly. She was trying so hard to maintain that flawless composure, but I could see through it now. The strain was clear. She was sweating profusely - forehead, cheeks, cleavage and legs – all were glistening. I once again proposed to find a bathroom, but she refused to admit. “No Rex. Trust me – I don’t need to pee. I’m just feeling hot.” I nodded but nothing could convince me otherwise.

By the time we reached her place, she was barely holding it together. Her legs crossed tightly as she stood by the car, thanking me for the day with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. She was still fighting, still holding on, trying to act classy and sexy.

"Thanks again, Rex," she said, her legs moving and squirming on their own. Her bladder bulge was protruding by a good two inches.

"Anytime," I replied, my voice carrying a knowing edge as I watched her struggle to maintain her pride.

Negar turned, walking toward her door with deliberate, careful steps. She knew I was still there and grabbing herself was not an option. The poor girl could not prevent herself from arching forward though as her bladder screamed for a relief. Even as she waved back at me, her legs were pressed tightly crossed. I stood there, watching her until she disappeared inside, my mind filled with thoughts of how far she could push herself. It was only the first time, but I knew—Negar’s habit, her raw, stubborn control, was something I only dreamt of. And I WANTED HER!

My Second Experience:

The second time I witnessed Negar’s iron-clad control over her bladder was even more intense than the first. She had invited me to join her and a few college friends for a day out in town. I had been eager to go, not just for the outing itself, but to see how far she’d push herself in front of her friends, knowing she’d be drinking all day long.

Negar picked me up that morning around 9. When I opened the door, the sight of her took my breath away. She was dressed in a bodycon dress. “How did you even put that on”, I pointed toward the small dip of her belly button, clearly visible beneath the fabric. The dress squeezed her body so tightly that it outlined every curve and dip, heck even the straps of her thong under. And she kept tugging the hem down, trying to keep the barely-there length in place. She was already holding a nearly empty coffee cup, casually sipping through the straw as she focused on the road. I glanced at the door pocket and found an empty water bottle shoved in. “Why don’t you clear your trash away, Negar?”

“Trash?” She looked at it quizzically, “Don’t be silly Rex! I finished it on my way to get this coffee.”

We went to a café and parked our car there. From there we were supposed to go around by foot. By the time we arrived at the café to meet her friends it was already 10. She ordered some pancakes and another large coffee without a second thought, complete with extra whipped cream. Her friends ordered smaller drinks, like iced teas and waters, but Negar insisted on getting her large coffee like her life depended on it.

“Babe, you sure about that?” one of her friends asked, laughing lightly. “We don’t like to stop for powder rooms Negar…”

“When was the last time that I asked you guys to stop for me?”, Negar smirked as her friends couldn’t come up with a single incident. “Didn’t think so…”

Once we finished breakfast, all her friends used the café restrooms while Negar waited patiently. “Sometimes I feel we are out with school-kids Rex”, Negar rolled her eyes.

“C’mon Negar… It’s only natural.” I chimed in trying to suppress my horny-ness.

“But we haven’t even started…” She threw her hands in the air.

“You talk as if you don’t ever pee…” I pushed my luck hoping it didn’t backfire.

“REX! I too need to pee really really badly!” She slammed the table, “But look at me! I’m here talking to you because that’s more important. Peeing can wait…It’s such a waste of time…” She gestured by pointing her hands towards her body. “”

“Negar…Do you…” I was about to dig deeper, but her friends suddenly appeared and in no time we were on our way to the Old City. It was famous for its colourful streets and cute little boutiques and shops. Her friends tried on jewellery and clothes, while Negar & I followed them, clicking pictures. As the sun rose higher she took out her 500ml water bottle and started sipping. By the time it was noon, the bottle was empty. I assumed, looking at her bulging midsection and calculating her intake that she hadn’t peed for 6 hours perhaps. Her bugle was casting a shadow on her dress now and seemed to irk her as she moved around.

A few hours later we had lunch and with it came a tall lemonade and a glass of water, Negar started to seem a bit annoyed with seemingly trivial things – say her friends taking too long in the bathroom or them clicking endless selfies in the restaurant and so on. It was 3pm now. Perhaps 9 hours since her last pee. Her bulge had grown significantly, and I could see it straining her dress. It didn’t give her any room for her bladder to expand and yet Negar fought with sheer willpower to act composed. She stood with her arms crossed together and subtly shifted her legs from one foot to the other. Two hours in, her friends were the again starting to show signs of needing a bathroom. I watched as they exchanged quick glances, their steps becoming slightly hurried. One of them finally laughed and announced, “I need to pee! Where’s the bathroom?”

Another friend nodded in relief. “Yes! Same here. Let’s go find one.”

Her friends nudged her to come with them. I looked over at Negar, expecting her to join them, but no!

“I’m fine,” she said smoothly with her jaws clenched tightly.

“You still don’t need to go?” one friend asked, incredulous. “We’ve been out all day. . .”

Negar shrugged, her voice steady but her jaw just a little tighter. “Nope, don’t want to.”

Her friends exchanged bewildered looks and left for the bathroom, leaving us alone. Now that we were alone, I could see the subtle changes. Her fingers tightened around her water bottle as she took another slow sip, her grip firm, almost like it was a battle. She shifted on her feet, crossing her legs. As I tried to maintain a conversation I watched her purse her lips and nodding her head a little too eagerly as if trying to distract herself. Down below her midsection looked eye-wateringly big and she constantly tried to tug the cloth away from her bulge. And the fabric would sharply slap against her bulge in her failed attempts, making her wince. When her friends returned, teasing her for “holding like a camel,” she smiled it off, though I could see the strain now. Her smile was tight, and her nails practically digging into her arms as she kept them folded.

We continued through the streets, and it was becoming more obvious that Negar’s iron-will was reaching her limits. Her steps slowed down, each one stiff and careful. When she thought we were not looking she would do a small curtsey dance or grab her thighs tightly. Her conversation became quieter, her answers shorter, and I could see her forehead and cleavage shining with sweat.

As the evening rolled, we went back to the same café as the morning one for some evening snacks. I suggested her to get a small, iced tea. “W-why small? I always take the large.” She re-adjusted her position and now she was almost hanging on the edge of the couch. I could fit in myself behind her and the backrest. When it arrived, she glanced over at me, that stubborn flicker of defiance in her eyes. She took a long, slow sip, forcing herself to drink even though her legs were now crossed tightly beneath the table. Her friends took their turn to excuse themselves to the restroom, and once again, Negar forced herself to not look at the bathroom door.

“I’m pretty impressed you know...” I complimented her, keeping my voice casual but watching her closely.

Negar quizzically looked at me.

“Well, you really didn’t go … all day and you are just tanking everything down.”

“Oh why! Thank you!” She forced a smile, though I could tell the words took effort. Her foot bounced rapidly under the table, her legs were crossed into a pretzel as she held her gaze on the glass, sipping deliberately. I could see her face twitch as she gulped down the whole thing. A while later she bade her friends adieu, and I could see how impatient Negar was getting. Her smiles were so fake and at one point she started frowning in the selfies. An extra half an hour later they finally left leaving me and Negar to return by her car.

Negar was BURSTING and how! One our way to the parking lot, Negar chose to walk a few steps behind me and only answered in monosyllables. The uneven clicking of her heels meant they made it more difficult for her to hold it. Her steps were wobbly. I had to pause and turn around so that she could catch up with me. Finally, as we reached the car, her face reddened further. She was clearly fighting her bursting needs with tooth and nails. To my surprise she opened the driver’s side door.

I saw her bite her lips – almost piercing it. She didn't realize the impact of all the liquid till she had to bend down to get inside the car. A small, panicked gasp escaped her thick lips, and her hands quickly moved to clutch the hem of her dress – not sure if she was trying to cover her crotch from showing or grabbing herself from an outburst. Her voice broke, her eyes squeezing shut as she crossed her legs tightly, pressing them together with all her might. Through the corner of her eyes, she caught a glimpse of the ladies room, but she didn’t say a word to me.

“Are you sure you can drive?” I asked, feigning innocence.

She glared at me, her face flushed. “What d-do you mean! Of course I can drive…” She couldn’t even finish the sentence as her voice turned shaky. She shut her eyes tight as she forced to uncross her legs. The low heighted sedan made her seat with knees nearly squishing her boobs – which meant there was no room for her swollen organ to go.” Every inch of her body was covered under sweat as she drove off to a jerky start. It was a sight to behold as I watched her move her feet to operate the pedals – she literally dug her nails in her thighs each time. Her fingers white with tension as she nearly dismounted the steering wheel.

An hour later she finally pulled over into my driveway. I slightly leaned towards her and whispered, “You are HOT! I’m starting to like you!” She giggled and then immediately gasped as her bladder spasmed probably. I took the cue and got off the car knowing fully well, she would wet herself but not admit that she had to pee. “Just call me when you reach.”

Another hour later, Negar’s call buzzed on my phone. I hurriedly answered it – my heart pounding in my mouth. “Hey Rex! I had a blast with you today. Can’t wait to see you again…” There was a distinct relief in her voice, and I could hear the distant sound of her flush refilling. I looked at the clock – it was 8pm. The girl held it for a strong 14 hours with so much intake. Looks like I finally found the woman I was looking for.

My Best Experience:

In the next couple of months we went out, on and off. There was a lot of sexual tension between us – PDAs, smooching in public, discreetly touching each other during meetings. Despite all that I felt Negar was hiding something and we never really got to actually making out. Perhaps because, by the end of the day Negar would be at the end of her tether. Truth be told, even I hid the fact that I drooled over her holding abilities and had a pretty good control myself. But this fateful evening, things were about to change. This is the story which began we truly fell for each other.

It was a warm Saturday evening. Around 6pm, I pulled up in front of Negar's house. She stepped out looking stunning as always, her tight black dress squeezing her curves like a second skin. Her cleavage was barely contained in those undersized cups and one sudden bump could be game-over for her. The length of her dress could put salsa dancers to shame, and she remembered how I loved seeing her in red undies. Her 6 inchers heels added to her hotness quotient. As she strutted towards me her boobs heaved and bounced. A suggestive smile played on her thick red lips as she looked down and then at me. I pulled her close to myself and gave her a deep wet smooch. I sensed her legs rubbing the inside of my thighs and her then I slid my hands over her bulge. That’s when I noticed, she was full. It was unlike her regular squishy bulge; it was more like a bowling-ball-full. After the breathless kiss, when we parted our lips, I couldn’t help but ask,

“Negar, you are… you are holding again, aren’t you?”

“C’mon Rex! Why do you always have to bring it up?” She said, rolling her eyes, “I hate taking pee breaks.” She completed her sentence, but her body didn’t seem to comply with it. I saw her curl her toes and immediately purse her lips. To me, it was clear that Negar was already desperate as usual. She just had a few hours before she would be frantic. I quickly hatched a plan to prolong the date night.

As she slid into the passenger seat, her face turned red. Negar seemed to hold her breath and only let it out after fastening her seat belt. She hissed through her teeth as it squeezed right over the apex of her bulge. In a flash, she crossed her legs tightly and gave a tight smile to me. I could see the way her fingers tightly gripped her knees. As we sped off, I noticed her adjusting herself every few seconds. Her usual cool demeanour was intact, but I could sense the urgency in her movements.

"So, ready for dinner?" I asked, trying to keep my tone casual as we neared the restaurant.

"Absolutely," she replied, a hint of forced cheer in her voice. She un-crossed her legs. The way her brows raised as she landed her feet told me that she was staving off a tremendous pressure inside her. Her hand drifted down briefly to her crotch when she thought I wasn’t looking, almost as if she was checking herself.

As we reached the restaurant and took our seats, Negar immediately ordered a small glass of iced tea. I got myself a large one. When the waiter placed mistakenly placed my large one in front of her, I saw her face turn pale. Though I was quick enough to rectify it and gave her the small drink. “Why a small one today?” I teased her.

“N-nothing.” She didn’t quite look at me as she squeaked the answer. The poor girl couldn’t even cross her legs to her comfort because of the transparent tabletop. She drank with her usual confidence, but her posture was tense. She sat at the edge of the seat and her legs remained glued together the whole time. Every so often, I noticed her glancing towards the restroom doors. Her gaze lingered for just a second each time, and then she would look away, straightening herself and sipping her drink as though nothing were out of the ordinary.

“Another tea?” I asked, my tone playful as she finished her first glass.

She hesitated for a brief moment but nodded. “Why not? It’s a nice night,” she replied with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. I noticed her hand gripping the edge of the table, her knuckles paling slightly as she shifted her weight again. I could see her foot beginning to bounce lightly beneath the table. Throughout dinner, she kept up the conversation, but her usual animated gestures were more restrained. As an hour turned into two, Negar couldn’t bear it anymore and she finally crossed her legs, flashing me a great view of her red undies. I wasn’t complaining and neither was she. In fact, as the minutes kept passing, she’d cross and uncross her legs under the table, then cross them back again. As food was served, she kept one hand firmly on her thighs, with her tightly gripping it. I noticed her glancing toward the restroom door a few more times, her gaze lingering a little longer each time. It was like she was considering something but holding herself back.

“Negar,” I said finally, raising an eyebrow, “Do you want to use the bathroom?”

“REX! People will hear us.” She shot me a look. “I won’t GO! You may go, if you want…”

“Do I even look like I need to pee?” I looked down and then at her, suggesting that I sat perfectly relaxed with my legs wide apart. “I will go tomorrow morning, if I feel like.”

“Wait-WHAT!?” She quizzically looked at me. This was new information for her. She started rocking back and firth by this point and her legs bobbed restlessly under the table.

“I am surprised you never noticed…” I said plainly as we continued with dinner. By the time the plates were cleared, Negar was fidgeting noticeably. Her midsection looked artificial and the guests sitting around us started noticing her gasps and restlessness too. Her dress was tightly stretched across her bulge, and she was beginning to look badly distressed.

Finally, as the waiter cleared our plates, I leaned in and decided to address it.

“People are looking at us, Negar.” I whispered to her, “Just go! It’s ok I won’t tell anyone…”

She hesitated, her confident expression softening, for just a second before she quickly recovered. “Okay fine… it’s getting a bit too much” she admitted, almost reluctantly. “I AM holding quite a load to be honest…”

I raised an eyebrow. “Then why don’t you?”

Negar glanced over her shoulder toward the restrooms, biting her lip as she took in the long line of women waiting. She crossed her legs tightly, her hands clasping her thighs. “I… I don’t feel like waiting,” she said, her voice lower than usual. “It’s fine. I can hold it a bit longer.”

“You sure?” I asked, trying not to grin.

“You too are holding it, so why should I pee alone…” she replied, her jaw clenched as she forced a smile. She sat up straighter, pressing her thighs together tightly as she adjusted her posture again. But there was no denying the tension in her shoulders or the way her legs kept shifting.

I was so close to get her to admit it and rush to the bathroom, but she somehow controlled herself. Now, it was time to put my plan to action, “If you insist,” I said with a shrug, “How about a movie next?”

Her eyes widened, and she opened her mouth as if to protest. But then she quickly closed it, forcing a calm smile. “Yeah… sounds good.” She took the bait.

It was 11pm, when we reached the theatre. Negar was under such pressure that she couldn’t think straight. She was trying to remove the seat-belt without pressing on that button, half-sobbing, half-panicking. “It’s not coming out. It’s not coming out.” I had never heard her under so much strain. For a minute I thought she was going to lose it right there. I held her hand firmly and released the belt, “Negar! Calm the fuck down!” Once the belt was off, she leaned back in the seat and shoved her hand between her thighs, fanning them. It was past the time she usually reached home. No wonder her bladder was screaming for its scheduled release. She walked besides me in baby steps. Her breath came in sharp hisses. Those pointed heels further worsened the matter. She was bursting, and by now, she didn’t even try to hide it.

After we grabbed our tickets, I glanced at her. “Negar, you should really run to the restroom before the movie starts.”

Negar bit her lip, shifting her weight from one foot to the other as she considered it. “I really do,” she admitted, her voice low and strained. “FUCK!” She muttered and started walking towards the ladies room with her head hung low. My own bladder was throbbing for a release merely looking at her, but I silenced it, as I always did. I was actually surprised that it was so easy to get her to use the bathroom. I was having mixed feelings, so I thought of getting a large fruit soda for her to get her desperate once again. By the time I got two giant ones, Negar was back already. Her face was red, and she stood with her arms folded tightly. I glanced down at her legs, which kept shifting restlessly.

“I couldn’t go!” She whispered. “They were cleaning it and now the movie’s about to start… I’ll manage.” She tightly grabbed my arm for support, “I really need to sit down.”

When we reached the seat I handed her the oversized soda. “Why would you get that?” She whisper-yelled at me.

“I wanted something to drink…and I thought you would have relieved yourself.” I pretended, “I will finish both of it, don’t worry.”

“NOOO!” She grabbed her soda back, “I know you are holding too…”

“Chill Negar, I went last night. I can easily wait till tomorrow night, if need arises…” I said nonchalantly.

“ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?” Her jaws were on the ground. I merely winked at her and didn’t comment further. She was right that I needed to pee. In fact I had consumed way more than her, but I was confident that I could control myself.

Soon, the theatre lights dimmed, casting a shadow over her as she crossed her legs into a pretzel. Even before the movie title came up, her fingers gripped the armrests as she tried to get comfortable. It was a losing battle. Her movements were becoming increasingly tense, and she kept fidgeting, as if trying to ignore the ever-present pressure inside her. The opening credits rolled, and I leaned in. “Are you sure you’re okay? You can try going one more time before the movie begins. She turned to me, her jaw clenched, and forced a smile. “I don’t want to disturb the people around. I have no option but to hold it.” she whispered, though her voice was taut with strain. Her thighs pressed together even tighter, and she tried to settle back in her seat with a determined expression.

But as the movie went on, I could see her composure slipping. I had no clue how she kept sipping from her soda, but every time she took a drink, she winced at it. She could not recline for even a minute. Her legs were constantly shifting, crossing, and recrossing, her foot bouncing restlessly against the carpeted floor. “Still good?” I whispered about halfway through the movie. She didn’t look at me, just nodded quickly. “Hanging on,” she whispered, but I could see her biting her lip, her body tensing as she adjusted her position again and again.

“Could you please be silent?” Her neighbour taunted her.

She froze in her seat. Her legs were knotted now, and she was not looking at the screen anymore. Despite her efforts her movements kept growing more frantic. Her eyes were shut tight and head hung low. An hour in, it was clear she was at her limit. Her bulge was grotesque and the side-zip which held her dress in place was starting to come off. Her breaths were short and shallow, and she’d barely touched her soda in the last half-hour.

Every few minutes, she’d uncross her legs, shift, and recross them, fanning them slightly in a slow, deliberate motion before pressing them back together with even more force. But she refused to get up and go despite her maddening need to pee.

The final stretch of the movie was intense, and so was Negar’s struggle. I heard her yelp and squeak every time a sudden explosion happened on screen. She didn’t say a word, but her flushed cheeks, tense jaw, and strained posture said it all—Negar was holding on by sheer force of will. As the credits finally rolled, she let out a quiet, shaky breath. The lights came back on and her skimpily clad body was shining with sweat.

“Negar? Will you be able to walk outside?” I asked, though by now, I was pretty sure I knew the answer.

She shot me a quick look, lips pressed into a tight line. “I… I can’t hold it for much longer,” she muttered, breathlessly. I glanced at the watch. It was 2pm. I felt her nails pierce my arm, as I helped her to get up from the seat. We waited for the hall to get empty and only then we made our way out of the hall.

As we exited the theater, I saw her eyes dart toward the restrooms. She hesitated, looking over at me with an almost pained expression. “I—I really need to go,” she murmured, her voice barely audible.

“Then go ahead. I’ll wait,” I said, gesturing toward the bathroom line.

She nodded and hurried off, her steps stiff and small, her back straight as she made her way over. A few minutes passed, and then I saw her approaching me again, walking even slower, her face flushed, and her eyes slightly widened with panic. “There’s a huge line,” she whispered, her voice a bit shaky. “It’s barely moving, and I… I don’t think I can wait that long.” She swallowed, looking at me with a kind of vulnerability I’d never seen from her. Her eyes were brimming up.

“Let’s head to the car, then. We’ll get you somewhere soon,” I assured her, leading the way.

As we walked, I could hear her soft, frustrated breaths behind me. Every few steps, she would pause, bend over, and then continue walking. Her heels were making her life hell. “I can’t walk Rex… In these heels.” I got the hint and took her in my arms. I saw her face scrunched up as she fought the jolts and bounces of being carried. Once we reached the car, she slipped into the passenger seat, her hands immediately flew to her crotch. Her fingers were practically digging into her crotch as she fought to keep herself under control.

The moment I started driving, she inhaled sharply as if steeling herself for the short ride, but every bump in the road made her fidget in her seat. Her thighs were pressed together so tightly that her knuckles turned white, and her toes curled inside her heeled sandals. I could see beads of sweat forming along her hairline as she bit her lip, her jaw clenched in concentration.

“Rex,” she whispered after a few minutes, her voice trembling, “Could we… could we please just go to your place? I—I really don’t think I’m going to make it all the way back to mine.”

I glanced over, and for the first time, I saw a flicker of genuine panic in her eyes. She was barely holding on, her entire body taut and rigid as she fought to keep control. “Of course,” I replied, turning the car in the direction of my place, which was closer.

After a few moments, I couldn’t help but ask, “Negar, I know you always hold it in all day …But how did you end up in such a… state? How long have you been holding for?”

She gasped for air before answering. She was fighting waves after waves and her voice still shaking. “Since yesterday morning,” she admitted, pressing her thighs together as she squirmed in her seat. “I only go t-twice a day… usually once when I wake up around 6 and then in the evening around 10. 16-17 hours d-daily. It’s just that it’s already well past when I’d usually… go.” The clock on the dashboard read 2AM and I was so happy that she was opening up to me.

I blinked, glancing at her in surprise. “Twice a day? That’s impressive! And you’re still dry after 20 hours now! How much have you had to drink today?”

Negar hesitated, gripping the seat tightly and letting out a shaky breath. “Well, even before you picked me up, I’d had about three litres of water,” she murmured. “And then al the drinks later” She gave a small, tight smile. “I think I might’ve overdone it.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You could have at least dressed more comfortably or asked me to skip the movie…. That dress looks painted on.”

She opened one eye to look at me, her lips curved to form a mix of smile and grit, “I want to look g-good when I am out with you, even if it means breaking my ribs.” She pulled her legs up on the seat and curled into a ball.

“Well, I’ll give you this—you’re tough,” I replied, unable to hide a smile. “Most people would’ve wet themselves by this point. But you’re still dry..”

“I am n-not so sure about t-that…” She let out a breathless chuckle, her body shifting with another wave of discomfort. “I just want to hold it till we get there…” she whispered, more to herself than to me, her jaw clenched as if to reinforce her resolve. “Looks like I have limits too…”

The zip of her dress had come down nearly to her waist. Her boobs were now hanging out and I was HARD as STEEL. My manhood was throbbing with dual pressure. The way her body twitched, her curves shined with sweat and her soft moans. I had to quickly squeeze my thing. Her thighs pressed together with every ounce of strength she had. “Just… just a little longer,” she muttered to herself, her voice barely above a whisper, as if willing her body to cooperate.

I looked over, shaking my head in amazement. “You’ve really pushed yourself tonight, haven’t you?”

Her lips twisted into a strained smile. “Yes… but I’ll make it. I always d-do,” she replied.

After another snail-paced half-an-hour, I finally pulled over into my driveway. Negar was suddenly alert now. “N-no-noooooo” She curled up again, grabbing her pussy, tighter than a vice. “Just keep it in godammit!” She yelled to herself. I hurriedly went to the other side and opened the door. I waited for her to step out, but she didn’t dare to move. I unbuckled her seat belt and again took her into my arms. Her thighs were sweaty, and she left a nice imprint on the seat. “Hope you didn’t leak.” I tried to lighten the mood as I reached the patio.

“I have… I am gonna burst Rex! Help me.” She was weeping now.

“Just a minute…” I fumbled with the keys while still carrying her. Fortunately, I opened the door swiftly and rushed to the bathroom. The porcelain bowl was right there shining. I let her down on it and left.

I was waiting for the flood to be unleashed but nothing was heard. I knocked on the door a few minutes later, “Negar what happened? Are you ok?”

“I…” She couldn’t even talk properly, “I want y-you to pee first..”

“I am not going to pee Negar. It’s ok you can go first…” I tried to pacify her. If I were to be honest all the drinks and the pee situation had definitely worsened my need but I was not going to pee so easily.

“Pl-leasee…I…I am embarrassed…” She pleaded. “Promise m-me, you won’t j-judge me.”

I was dumbfounded how soft she actually was. I kissed her on the forehead and calmed her down. “I won’t judge you Negar. Please just g-go!” I again stepped out and waited some more. But still, I didn’t hear her go.

Around ten more minutes passed and then finally I heard her call me, “R-Re-ee-ex. H-Hh-eeelp-pp” I barged in at once. She was still standing – her legs crossed and hand shoved in crotch. “Dress…z-zip..stuck…”

“SCREW IT NEGAR!” I yelled, “Just let it go!” I made her sit on the WC.

“NOOOO!” She leaned on me weeping. “H-help me to t-take it off. I don’t want to w-wet myself!”

I nodded and helped her to stand. Her legs were wobbling and bumping against my manhood. I loved the feeling but now was not the time. I hurriedly shoved my fingers between her dress and her bruised torso. After a quick countdown I yanked it down and for the first time I had Negar standing in front of me – TOPLESS and bursting for a pee! I helped her peel off her tight red undies as she shuddered. “You’re still dry!” I complimented her, “Not …dry.” She sobbed as I found another nude-coloured pantie underneath. I nearly came in my underwear as I spotted a wet patch on it.

“I w-wear two to prevent l-leaks!”

“GOD! YOU’RE HOT!” I grabbed her and made her sit on the WC, while I was still kneeled in front. Her overworked muscles could no longer bear the load, and they finally burst open. Her nude undies turned darker by the second and soon a thick gusher of pent-up pee came gurgling out. The splattering sound was loud and it was so forceful that it started spraying. Her mouth gaped wide, and eyes rolled upwards. Her sweaty body shuddered. Her nails dug in to my shoulders.

Her bulge was pulsating. She was experiencing an orgasmic bliss. I still held her by her waist and I could feel her body tensing up and loose every few seconds in rhythm as her bladder kept contracting violently to push out the steaming load. She just kept going. Her labia quivered in between, splattering the pee here and there and then continuing again. Somehow, her torrent refused to die. From the gap between her thighs, I saw the level of the water rising underneath. At the rate she was pissing, I feared she would overflow it. I tried to warn her but she barley paid any heed. Nothing could stop her from getting that well-deserved relief. I looked at her face. Her eyes were half open and her moans kept getting louder with every passing minute. Only after three minutes, her force trickled down and finally came to a halt.

Negar was empty or so I thought. She broke out of trance and returned to her mortal self. She gasped for air and “Oh my fucking god! I really needed to goooo Rex!” Her words were driving me crazy, and her spectacular outburst was too much for me to bear. My bladder was screaming for a relief too. I hurriedly got up and started to unbutton my jeans when Negar grabbed my hand and pulled me down.

I clenched my muscles as hard as I possibly could to listen to her. And then she suddenly leaned forward to kiss me. I MEAN KISS ME like she owned me. The pressure inside my dick was replaced with arousal. As I kissed her back and started feeling her up, she shuddered. I wanted to ask what happened, but she kept going and all of a sudden she let out another gusher finally overflowing the WC.

“I love you Rex!” She whispered. “You are the only man who could do this to me….”

Her words still echo in my ears. I can’t wait to tell you more about her but for now I gotta go. Can’t keep my lady waiting….
