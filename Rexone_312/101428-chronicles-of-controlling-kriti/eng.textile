Hi Omo Lovers! I am bringing to you yet another character who is absolutely obsessed with holding her pee. This is an on-going commission and one which was specifically designed to bring out the raw obsession with controlling one's bladder. Our heroine is a 23 year old girl named Kriti and her adventures with Rex. (Please note: This story involves some bits of male desperation too.)

Also if any of you lovely people are looking for someone to write captivating, complex omo stories for you, please DM me. I will be happy to take commissions :-)

###

The First Meet:

There are people who are obsessed, then there are people who are super-obsessed. And then there’s Kriti who just can’t get enough of pee holding. I recorded all our adventures in my journal.. .

It was one of the initial weeks at my post-grad. As always I really needed to pee by the end of the last lecture – like I was clenching and un-clenching every few minutes to fight the waves. But I liked it this way, relishing the tension in my bladder, a kind of thrill that made the day a bit more interesting.

"Hey Rex!" Julia's voice called out from behind me. I turned to see her and Lila hurrying towards me, big grins on their faces.

"Hey guys," I greeted, shifting slightly from one foot to the other. I'd drunk at least three bottles of water, two cups of coffee, and a large, iced tea throughout the day. The combination had created a rather urgent situation, but I wasn't quite ready to give in.

"We were just about to head out to the movies," Lila said, glancing at me curiously. "You look like you're in a rush."

"Uh, no, just... thinking about stuff," I replied, trying to sound casual. "Which one are we going to?"

"Kiriti chose that Justice League Snyder Cut.”

"Fuck! That’s a 4-hour long movie." Lila looked concerned. “She needs to know not everyone can control their pee like her.”

All my senses got electrified immediately, especially down there. “What do you mean?” I tried to supress my excitement.

“Just ignore it Rex. Kriti is crazy. She just never pees.” Julia said sighing.

“Do you mind waiting here till we will use the washroom. Kriti is not going to go anyways.” Lila pulled Julia and hurried off to the restroom, leaving me standing there, shifting from foot to foot. I checked my watch. How long could they possibly take? Not that I was complaining. A couple of minutes later I found myself shifting my weight from one foot to the other, when I heard a teasing voice from behind me.

"Hi! You must be Rex! Hi, I’m Kriti.” I turned to see a bombshell smiling naughtily at me.

“Hey Kriti, nice meeting you.” I cheerfully responded. My eyes were watering as I forced myself to not stare at her heaving cleavage, or her chiselled midriff, of her skirt that barely reached her crotch.

"Nice to meeeet you Rex.” Kriti’s words stretched as she looked at me with confusion. Well, the vein on my forehead could have popped out. Then she looked down at her boobs, threatening to burst out of her tank top. She bit her lips and again teased me, “You are perhaps the only guy who looked at me in the eye.”

Before I could respond, Julia and Lila reappeared, looking much more comfortable. “You wanna go?” Julia asked, pointing towards the restroom door.

“Babe, it’s Tuesday. I don’t pee on Tuesdays.” Kriti rolled her eyes. That’s when I ACTUALLY looked at her midriff. She was so petite that her bladder bulge jutted out like a pillow under a sheet.

No Toilet Tuesdays:

“I don’t pee on Tuesdays...” Kriti’s words kept echoing in my head as we walked to the theatre. My gaze never left her contoured midsection. I didn’t even bother to check the projection of her bust in that toddler sized top. Despite that belt squeezing her bulge into two parts like an hourglass, she didn’t flinch or squirm even once. There were a few moments when I caught her looking at the tent inside my pant. Loved to watch the corner of puffy lips bend into a supressed smile.

Inside the theatre, we settled into our seats. Julia and Lila were busy chatting about the latest campus gossip, while I tried to focus on anything but the pressure in my bladder. Kriti, on the other hand, looked perfectly at ease, even though I knew she had to be feeling the same urgency. How did she do it? But there were more surprises to come. As we sat down, Kriti turned to us with a mischievous grin. “Anybody want anything to drink?”

“I’ll have a soda,” Lila said. “Me too!” Julia chimed in.

“Great,” Kriti said, standing up. “What about you Rex?”

I stared at her, flabbergasted. Was she serious? "Uh, I’m good," I managed to say, not trusting myself to drink anything more.

“C’mon dude!” She playfully nudged me. “You can sneak out if nature calls. I am not going to judge you.”

She winked at me and left from her seat. I watched her walk away, her butt cheeks wiggling under that teeny tiny skirt. She came back with a tray balancing five sodas, three small and two giants sized colas. By giant I mean, they were almost the size of my thighs. Then, to my utter astonishment, she downed half of her first cola in one go even before the movie began. “God I was thirsty.” She licked her lips and then immediately continued to chug the rest. As the movie started, I tried to concentrate on the plot, but my mind kept drifting back to Kriti. She sat there, calmly sipping her drinks, her face showing no signs of discomfort. Her toned legs were casually crossed and hands brushing against mine. I gulped down my throat as I struggled with that puny soda. My nails dug into the armrest. My butthole clenched tight as I fought the onslaught of waves. It was getting impossible to sit still.

Halfway through the movie, I glanced over at Kriti. Her first cola was long gone, and she was happily sipping her second one, her face serene. “Gal Gadot must have such a strong bladder, just look at her one-piece costume.” Kriti giggled. Seriously, she was thinking about other’s bladders without a care of her own. How on earth was she doing it? Meanwhile, I was practically dancing in my seat, trying to stay composed. By the end of the movie, my bladder was screaming for relief. Kriti stood up slowly.

The weight of 2 litre of colas was weighing her down. Beads of sweat appeared on her forehead but apart from that – NOTHING. No squirming, no clenching of teeth. Nil, nada! She had to pull her skirt up against her considerably larger bulge. I had tears in my eyes thinking of how her nerves were firing inside her, but she didn’t make a move toward the bathroom. Julia and Lila, on the other hand, practically bolted from their seats the moment the credits rolled, disappearing into the restroom with a sense of urgency that I envied.

Kriti and I stood just outside the bathroom, both of us silent as we watched the bustle of people coming and going. I subtly shifted my weight from one foot to other. Kriti stood with her hands on her waist, tapping her foot. “They always have to pee after a movie.” She pouted. The tension between us was palpable. After a few moments, I couldn’t resist continuing the topic.

"So, Kriti," I began, trying to sound casual. "Do you really not pee on Tuesdays?"

Kriti’s eyes twinkled mischievously as she turned to me. "Oh, I know it sounds absurd but yeah! I call it No-Toilet-Tuesdays." she replied with a grin. "Even the rest of the days are more or less the same. Peeing just feels like such a waste of time, you know?"

I couldn’t help but chuckle at her response. "Yeah, I can relate. I haven’t gone since yesterday morning too," I said trying to show my strength.

“Yesterday morning,” Her expression changed from surprise to confusion.

“I thought you have been holding longer than me.” She chuckled and came closer. What did she mean? She was holding for even longer. A bucket load of blood rushed towards my manhood.

“Guess that makes two of us who like to play this game.” I blurted out cluelessly.

"Exactly!" Kriti exclaimed, nodding in agreement. "Who needs the bathroom when you’ve got willpower?"

As we exited the theatre, we all walked to a nearby restaurant to grab dinner. The cool evening air did little to alleviate the growing urgency in my bladder. As we sat down and ordered, I couldn’t help but marvel at Kriti. She was quieter now, her movements more deliberate, but still no sign of giving in. When our drinks arrived, I stared at my water, debating whether to take a sip. Kriti, on the other hand, took a long drink from her glass, her face a mask of calm.

“You okay, Kriti?” Julia asked, noticing her unusual quietness.

“Yeah, just a bit tired,” Kriti replied with a smile. I thought I had finally caught her desperate but no! I imagined that her legs would be crossed like a pretzel under the table. But boy was I wrong. In fact, she was relaxed enough that I got an eyeful of upskirt. The rest of the dinner was a mix of laughter and casual conversation, but I couldn’t fully focus on it. Even on our way back the girls kept chattering. I was quiet and my eyes were scanning her for the slightest sign of discomfort. Instead, I saw the button on her skirt was fighting for its life while she kept enacting the characters from the movie like a goofball.

I had no idea how she did this, but one thing was for sure, my post-grad is definitely going to be exciting AF.

The Button Won’t Come Off:

Another mind-bending experience which is still etched in my mind.

It was one of those mornings where the alarm felt like a betrayal. I rolled out of bed, determined to stick to my plan: no morning pee and add some extra thrill to my day. It was the first time that I and Kriti were going to have common classes throughout the day, and I wanted to challenge myself to hold with Kriti. By the time I arrived, my bladder was uncomfortably full, like I had to prevent jostling my bladder too much.

I spotted Kriti in the hallway before our first class. She was cheerful as ever, chatting animatedly with a few of her friends. She was dressed in tight racer back and jeans which looked more like they were painted on. Her waist already had red marks of the fabric denting into her skin. But what caught my eye, though, was the moderate bulge at her abdomen, a clear sign that she was already well into her usual bladder-holding routine.

“Hey, Rex!” she greeted me with a bright smile. “Ready for another fun day?”

“Absolutely,” I replied, trying to sound nonchalant. “You seem… prepared as usual.”

Kriti laughed, patting her water bottle. “Oh, you know me. Gotta stay hydrated!”

Throughout our classes, I watched as Kriti kept sipping water, her bottle gradually emptying. I was curious how she managed it with such ease. Then, partway through the morning, she stood up and announced, “I need to go to the bathroom.”

I raised an eyebrow, genuinely surprised. “Really?” I asked, unable to hide my skepticism.

Kriti grinned. “Only to refill my water bottle. Don’t worry, Rex. My bladder’s still holding strong.”

Relieved yet impressed, I nodded. “You’re something else, Kriti.”

As the morning turned into lunchtime, we grabbed a table with a few friends. Lunch consisted of sandwiches and, of course, more drinks. I opted for a large, iced tea, while Kriti went for a giant smoothie. I could feel my bladder stretching, but I kept my discomfort under wraps, determined to maintain my composure. After lunch, we headed back to class. I was nearing my limit, but I knew I couldn’t let it show, especially not in front of Kriti. As we settled into our seats, Kriti was called up for her presentation. She looked a bit nervous, and I noticed her chugging down a full liter of water just before her turn.

She took the floor with confidence, delivering her presentation flawlessly. There was no sign of discomfort or squirming, even as she stood there with a bladder that must have been on the verge of bursting. I couldn’t help but admire her poise. Once classes were over, I was ready to rush back to my dorm and finally relieve myself. But Kriti had other plans. “Hey, Rex, want to study together in the library?” she asked, her eyes sparkling with that familiar challenge.

“Sure, why not?” I replied, even though my bladder was practically screaming at me.

The library was cold, which didn’t help matters. We found a quiet corner and settled in with our books. Kriti’s movements were slower now, and she kept her legs tightly glued together. Yet, she continued to surprise me. Half an hour into the session she ordered green tea for both of us. What appeared to be an innocent study aid turned out to be a river of tea. She downed the tea, cup after cup, without a hint of desperation on her face. I mirrored her actions, grabbing a tea for myself.

“You really don’t make this easy, do you?” I joked, trying to keep my voice steady.

Kriti laughed softly. “What’s the fun in easy? Besides, it’s a good way to stay focused.”

As the evening wore on, the cold library air made everything worse. Kriti’s determination was inspiring, though. Her legs remained firmly pressed together and her focus razor sharp. By 9 we had our dinner with some more water. She looked a little unsure as we headed back to the library. Upon asking she brushed it off saying, “My jeans is so tight. Its fucking killing me my Bladder.”

“I can wait if you want”, pointing to the ladies room.

“Oh no Rex! That’s not what I meant. I contain way more than this even when I pee.” She grabbed my arm tightly, blushing and squishing her rack.

“What do you mean?”

She just smiled to me and shrugged it off

Back at the library, we exchanged glances, both of us aware of a silent competition. “Fancy some more tea?” Kriti asked with a grin. I forced a smile and nodded in a yes. The hours ticked by, the cold air making the pressure in my bladder even more unbearable. I went under the table making an excuse of picking up my pen. I sneakily ogled at her bladder, which was so swollen that it was casting a shadow on her crotch. Yet, she made no move towards the bathroom. We sat there, sipping our tea, working on our assignments, and silently challenging each other to hold on just a little longer. By midnight we were both tired and decided to call it a day.

“Kriti, you’re amazing, you know that?” I said, packing my bag.

She looked up, her eyes twinkling. “You’re not too bad yourself, Rex. It’s all about mind over matter.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. “Yeah, mind over bladder, more like.”

I went ahead and tried to open the door to exit but it didn’t budge. My throat went dry as I realized we were locked in. Kriti and I had been so immersed in our studies that we failed to notice when the guards locked the door.

“Kriti,” I whispered urgently. “I think we’re locked in.”

She looked up at me, her eyes widening. “Are you serious?”

She hurriedly came to the door, pulling and pushing with all her might, but in vain. We dialled security, but there was no answer. We tried calling our friends but had no network on our phones either. We were well and truly stuck.

“Guess we’re spending the night here,” Kriti said with a resigned shrug. Despite the situation, she seemed remarkably calm. She pulled up her jeans tighter and collapsed on the couch. I could literally she her bulge sloshing under her skin. Meanwhile, I was failing miserably at hiding my growing desperation. I paced back and forth, trying to distract myself from the increasing pressure. Kriti, in contrast, settled onto the couch with a yawn, her legs crossed but still composed.

“How can you be so relaxed?” I asked, exasperated.

Kriti shrugged, leaning back. “Mind over bladder, remember?”

I couldn’t help but laugh despite my discomfort. “You’re something else, Kriti.”

Eventually, exhaustion took over, and Kriti fell asleep on the couch, her breathing steady and serene. I, on the other hand, was pacing like a caged animal, unable to sit still for more than a few minutes. I paced around, tried to read and even meditate. But nothing fucking worked. There was a time when I thought about letting it go in a dustbin but my conscience stopped me. Kriti wouldn’t even look at me if I did something so horrific.

Somehow, I managed to doze off in a chair, but it was a restless sleep. When I woke up, morning sun was streaming through the library windows. My bladder pushed the pent-up pee to my dick with renewed vigour. My bladder was beyond full, and I was on the brink of losing control. I spotted Kriti still asleep on the couch, looking oddly peaceful despite the tremendous bulge in her abdomen. It had somehow grown even bigger. As I ogled at her washboard flat torso, I realized the projection of her bladder was just as striking as her massive breasts. I shook her shoulder gently. “Kriti, wake up! The library is about to open.”

She stirred, blinking sleepily. “Morning already?” she mumbled, stretching. “How are you holding up?”

“Not well,” I admitted, pulling at my hair in despair. “We need to get to the dorms, like, NOW.”

Kriti glanced at her watch and shook her head. “I have class in ten minutes. I’ll go straight there.” Her eyes widened in disbelief and then squinted in disappointment, as she looked at her bulge, “HOW THE FUCK the button is still intact. I was confident it would come flying off like the other time.. .” She covered her face and grunted.

My jaw dropped. “Are you kidding me?”

“Never mind Rex! I just have ten minutes to my classes.” She said nonchalantly as she packed her bag.

“Kriti, you haven’t peed since yesterday, and you’re just going to go to class?”

“Correction, not just yesterday.” She smiled serenely. “Yep. I can handle it. You do you, Rex.”

I couldn’t believe her composure. “You’re insane,” I said, half in admiration, half in disbelief.

“I prefer determined,” she replied with a wink.

With that, she gathered her things and headed off to her class. I watched her go, still in shock at her level of control. As for me, I couldn’t wait any longer. I bolted towards my dorm, each step feeling like it would be my last before bursting.

“Good luck, Rex!” she called after me, her voice full of amusement.

“Thanks!” I shouted back, sprinting as fast as I could.

Finally reaching my dorm, I raced to the bathroom, relief in sight. I couldn’t help but scream at myself for being so weak. Kriti’s calm control was something to aspire to, but for now, I was just happy to have made it through the night, without wetting myself. As I finally relieved myself, I thought maybe, just maybe, next time I’d be able to hold it as well as she did.

Amazing story. I absolutely loved it. I wonder if Kriti will ever reach her limit.

}}

The first comment on the story! It made my day. And you know, what the next few parts are ready as well. Incoming below :-D

Another jaw-dropping experience was when Kriti invited herself to my dorm.

It was a typical Friday morning when my phone buzzed with a text from Kriti. “Hey, Rex! AC’s broken down in my room. Mind if I hang out in yours today?” I stared at the message with mixed feelings. On one hand, spending the day with Kriti was always fun. On the other hand, she had an uncanny ability to beat me at the holding game, and my bladder was already uncomfortably full. I decided it was best to relieve myself before she arrived to avoid any potential embarrassment.

Just as I was about to head to the bathroom, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to find Kriti standing there, her signature cheerful grin in place. Even her best attempts to dress casually made her look provocative. Today she was dressed in a thin t-shirt and undies. Her nipples poked through the semi-transparent fabric. As I cast my glance further down, I saw a moderate bladder bulge contouring against the fabric. But unlike the other times, it was not grotesque, yet.

“Hey, Rex!” she greeted, stepping into the room. “Looks like I beat you to it. If you need to, you know, go, don’t let me stop you.”

I felt a flush of embarrassment. “Nah, I’m good,” I said, forcing a smile. “Ready to tackle some assignments?”

Kriti laughed and plopped down on my couch. “Always! Let’s get to it.”

We spent the morning finishing off our assignments. Kriti kept sipping from her water bottle, refilling it several times without a hint of discomfort. Meanwhile, I was doing my best to ignore the persistent pressure in my own bladder. Every so often, she’d catch my eye and give me a teasing smile, which only fuelled my determination to hold on. By lunchtime, my bladder was screaming for relief, but I maintained my composure. We ordered some food, and Kriti opted for a large smoothie along with a soda. I had a sandwich and a glass of water, trying to keep up appearances.

“You know,” Kriti said between sips, “this smoothie is amazing. You should try one.”

“Maybe later,” I replied, my voice tight. “Wouldn’t want to overdo it.”

The afternoon passed in a blur of game streaming. We picked a couple of hack and slash games and slayed our way through them. Kriti, ever the hydration enthusiast, kept drinking, her bladder visibly growing but her demeanor unchanged. I was squirming internally, but I couldn’t let her see me falter. After the games, we hit the gym. It was a risky move, but I was determined to keep up with Kriti. We started with some cardio, and I could feel every jolt with each step. Kriti, on the other hand, was a picture of calm, even as she guzzled down another bottle of water. Her two-piece gym bikini was stretched to its limits.

“Kriti I think you should slow down” I pointed towards her stretched, sweat-stained bottoms.

“No, Rex, my bladder needs to exercise too. It is difficult, I won’t like but there are no bathroom breaks in my life.” She smiled and continued with her high-intensity cardio.

“I agree.” I lied, wiping sweat from my forehead. I watched her spend the next 30 minutes doing all sorts of jumps, squats, stretching and what not. Her protein shake was long gone and perhaps sitting inside her balloon already.

After returning to the dorm, she begged me to take her to for a shower. It was a boys hostel, mind you. My heart was racing. What if the other guys spotted us? What if I spring a leak with all that water sloshing around? What if I get a boner? “Kriti, as much as you want to bathe, it is risky. Besides, you said all that exercise makes it difficult for you to hold. I am sure you don’t show it on your face, but you must be surely bursting by now. And if you need to go, someone might see us.. .” I blurted out without a pause.

“Listen Rex,” Kriti dabbed off her sweat and removed her sports bra. Her sweaty boobs popped out and my eyes were locked on it. “In my 22 years of life, I have never allowed myself to pee outside my bathroom. Just a day’s worth of pee can’t break me.” She remained adamant. And true to her words we took a shower together and she didn’t even squirm once despite the freezing water. It was me who was actually squirming and dancing. My desperation spoiled an otherwise raunchy session.

“Looks like YOU need to piss like a racehorse.” She giggled.

“I.. .” The cold water made it impossible to stand straight. “I really want to be as strong as you.”

“Oh baby! You have a long way to go then.” She winked at me and draped a towel around me.

Back at my room, we studied some more and then had some light dinner. The evening turned into night, and I was no longer able to sit still. My dick was burning and hard as steel. Kriti was definitely enjoying me bouncing around.

“You sure you don’t need to go?” Kriti asked, her eyes twinkling with mischief.

“I can manage,” I insisted, my voice a little strained. “What about you?”

“Let’s just say my 10-year-old self could hold more than this. So, the question is not applicable to me.” She grabbed her bottle and took a long swig at it. The entire litre was gone under 10 seconds. The confidence in her eyes was absolutely alluring and scary at the same time. My manhood gave a quick standing affirmation too. I saw her suppress a grin, “I love that you want to keep up with me. Makes me tingly.” She brushed my forearm with her perfectly manicured nails and slowly put her thighs on mine as we entered the blanket.

“A lot could happen between us Rex,” she whispered, “But you really need to up your game.”

The next morning, I woke up practically bursting. Kriti, however, looked as composed as ever. Needless to say I mistook her bladder bulge for her ass under the blanket. As I playfully spanked it she woke up with a jolt and pulled the blanket off her face. “Heyyyy!” She made a fake angry pout and then broke into a smile.

“That actually felt good. Could you do that again? Just squeeze it as hard as you can, will you?”

I never had an erection like that ever before. I slowly put my hand on her bulge and pierced my fingers into her supple skin - like an eagle clawing its prey.

“Oohhhh” She moaned hard, biting her puffy lips. Her fingers crumpled the bedsheet. Her thighs glued together, and toes curled. Her body shuddered slightly, and sharp breath hissed through her teeth.

I thought she would ask me to let go immediately but even after a few minutes she was in a trance. My fingers hurt, “Kriti my fingers are not used to squeeze iron”. She gasped for air, loudly. Her face was red and body drenched in sweat. “Damn! That felt soooo good!”

On our way back from our breakfast, she checked her phone and frowned.

“Looks like my AC still isn’t fixed. Guess I’m here for another day.”

I forced a smile, while my knuckles were going white with the efforts of controlling myself. “Great,” I said, trying to sound enthusiastic. “What’s on the agenda today?”

“A lot of things, but before we get to that, do you mind waiting outside for a bit?” Kriti asked, with a face more serious than a lawyer. I nodded, watching as she disappeared into the room. She must have been in a rush because the door didn’t quite latch shut. I stood there, waiting, and heard her moving around inside. Peeking through the slight gap in the door, I saw her hurriedly changing clothes. It was clear that she was under tremendous pressure. I half expected her to finally make a dash for the bathroom, but instead, she just sat there, perfectly still, as if trying to calm her rebellious bladder. After a few minutes, she hastily opened my laptop, browsed something, and took notes. After a while, I knocked on the door and entered the room, she quickly slammed the lid down with a sheepish smile.

“All OK?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Yeah, just needed to check something,” she replied not looking into my eyes.

For the remainder of the day, Kriti insisted on a movie marathon. I agreed, hoping she would be too distracted to drink more water. But, as usual, she surprised me. She kept drinking water like clockwork. I could sense her pelvis rock gently. Not too much to disturb me but definitely noticeable. As the afternoon turned into evening, I noticed her legs were now tightly crossed. Though she continued to be a chatterbox I could sense the strain of holding all that piss beginning to show.

“Are you okay?” I asked, genuinely concerned.

“I’m trying something new today,” she whispered, leaning in close. “Something to help me last longer than my last attempt.”

By late evening, Kriti had downed several more bottles of water. Her bulge was once again competing with her silicone globes in terms of projection. Her undies had slipped off dangerously low, exposing a small butterfly tattoo just near her coochie. But on her face, absolutely nothing. No wincing, no lip biting, no gritted teeth.

“Is your new technique working?” I asked, half-joking, half-serious.

“Absolutely not. In fact, quite the opposite.” she admitted with a wry smile. “But it’s fine..”

“Kriti you haven’t relieved since yesterday. Do you really never get desperate? Surely you must let it out some time or the other… ” I asked, though I already knew her answer.

“It doesn’t matter whether I haven’t gone since yesterday or may be even longer. The only thing that matters is me getting absolutely no bathroom breaks.” Kriti casually replied and cracked open another bottle.

Around midnight, she got a message on her phone. “Good news, Rex. The AC in my room is finally repaired. I guess I’ll head back.” As she gathered her things, I couldn’t help but admire her resilience. “What’s your plan for tomorrow?” I asked curiously.

She gave me a mischievous grin. “Well, I am going to see if this new experiment could break me.”

With that, she left my room, her steps deliberate but steady. As the door closed behind her, I hurriedly opened my laptop to check the browser history. My jaws dropped to the ground as I read her search query –

‘What’s the world record for holding pee?’

You still haven't seen what Kriti can truly do guys. Here's part 3!

###

We were approaching the end of the term in a month or so, when this happened.

One evening Kriti stopped me on my way back to my dorm. “Rex, I am going shopping for the next month’s fest. Wanna come?” She asked with a wide a conspiratorial grin.

“Absolutely,” I smiled to her, clenching my pee back from the tip of my dick.

“You look stiff, Rex?” Kriti pursed her lips as we walked out of the campus, “Skipped your pee again?”

“Since yesterday lunchtime.”, I admitted proudly, “But like you say, it doesn’t matter. If I am with you, I won’t take any bathroom breaks.”

“Oooh! That’s hot. You have no clue what your words are doing to me.” Kriti pushed me to a secluded corner, her eyes fixated on my lips, “I thought you were closer to me today.” She took my hands and placed on her belly. I felt that familiar solid bulge jutting out of her frame. She had hidden it well under her black bodysuit and a pleated skirt. I leaned forward for a kiss, but she naughtily crouched away.

“Not so easy big boy! if you want me, you gotta BEAT me!”

“How many hours are we talking?” My boner was so strong I could barely form a sentence.

“Not just hours honey, volume too.” She smirked and pulled us out of the corner.

A little later, we headed to the nearby mall, and Kriti was her usual goofy and chirpy self, though I couldn't help but keep stealing glances at her swollen belly. It was clear she hadn't relieved herself all day. Her bladder bulge was prominent, and her legs were often glued together as she kept shifting her weight from one foot to the other. She looked at the bathroom door with contempt as we walked past it. We stopped at a coffee counter.

"Kriti, when was the last time you went to the bathroom?" I asked, curious.

She shrugged, sipping her cold coffee. "I don't even remember. Definitely not today. Probably not even yesterday."

"Are you serious?" I said, my eyes wide in disbelief.

Kriti just laughed. "Oh, come on, Rex. It’s ok to not pee every day."

We browsed through various stores, and Kriti tried on several outfits. I was battling my raging hard on and desperation as she displayed her top-heavy figure in different outfits. With each one, I noticed her growing bladder bulge making it harder for her to fit into the clothes. She was sipping her coffee continuously, and it seemed like her bladder was expanding with every gulp. "Kriti, you sure you can fit into these clothes with that bulge. Maybe you can make an exception to find the right ones." I suggested, pointing towards her swollen abdomen.

She shook her head vigorously. "No way! Peeing cannot be the solution, Rex. It's all about mind over bladder. I am not even that big certainly."

She picked up a tight shapewear piece, examining it thoughtfully and then further rummaging through the stack. "This is XXS. Yeah this should help," she muttered, heading to the fitting room. I waited outside, slightly worried but mostly amazed by her determination. When she emerged, I almost came right there. Her boobs were bursting out of the cup. The seams dug into butt cheeks. The straps piercing into her shoulders. But most importantly, her bulge was absolutely flattened. She had an ear-to-ear smile on her face, though the sweating gave away the pressure she was under. "There, see? Problem solved," she said, huffing and puffing.

"Kriti, are you sure this is a good idea?" I asked, concerned. "You look like you're about to burst."

"Burst? Rex, trust me I practically live with more than this even after peeing.” she insisted, taking another sip of her coffee. "I’m not going to pee, even after we get back to my room. Peeing is such a waste of time."

As we continued shopping, Kriti kept trying on tight outfits deliberately, as if challenging herself. She'd giggle and comment on how they accentuated her figure, all while sipping her drink and refusing to show any signs of desperation. "Look at this one, Rex!" she exclaimed, holding up a form-fitting dress and then another and then a few more. "I think I’ll wear get them all for the upcoming fest. What do you think?"

"They all look great, but are you sure you'll be comfortable?" I asked, eyeing her growing bladder bulge.

Kriti laughed, brushing off my concerns. "Who says I dress for comfort?" She naughtily smiled and soon we were checking out from the store.

On our way back we grabbed some quick dinner and some more drink to cool off and finally returned to the campus. Just as she was about to go into her building she stopped, "Had it not been for you, I wouldn’t have gotten that shapewear. Thanks for coming with me. This was fun."

"Anytime, Kriti," I replied, shaking my head in disbelief. "Before you go... Were you serious when you said that if I beat you we could.. .”

"What do you think?" Kriti giggled and walked back inside, leaving me obsessed with her charm and her absolute control over her bladder.

Great story so far. I'd love to see Kriti's bladder get so full that she has to admit to Rex that it's getting to be an emergency, only for something to force her to continue holding it in for even longer.

You just made me day! Getting your opinion on the story means a lot to me 😊😊😊

Since this is an ongoing commission, I am waiting to hear from the original patron about his idea for the next chapter. Fingers crossed. However, I am slightly biased to write it in the direction that you mentioned here 🤤

Absolutely great story!

Nothing is more arousing than to see a girl’s bladder bulging out from her abdomen, to know that she didn’t pee for extreme long time, to know that she is needing to wee very, very urgently, but she still don’t go, or can’t go, or is not allowed to go!!

So hot the dialogue “ You look like you’re about burst.”

”I am not going to pee, even after we get back to my room! Peeing is such a waste of time!”

Rex, I'll be honest, your last couple of stories haven't really done it for me like your older ones did.

But this...... this is incredible!

I haven't had a story be stuck in my head like this one has, in years!

Your posts in general, but also now this story, are some of the reasons I look forward to checking this website.

Thank you for your current, past, and future contributions to this community and my life.

Hola pee-o-ple! Kriti didn't know when to stop and her obsession kept growing. Check it out in part 4!

###

Ever since our little shopping adventure, I had been training my bladder relentlessly. I wanted to show her my newfound capacity and perhaps out-hold her. A few weeks passed like that, and we arrived at the last day of the classes for the year. It was a Monday. To top it off, the annual fest was supposed to start from Wednesday. The ambience was filled with excitement. I was fully prepared to ask her out that day and was holding a solid 24 hour full bladder as my commitment.

Kriti walked into the class with an extra spring in her step. Dressed in a tight crop top and dangerously tiny shorts, she looked ravishing. She proudly showed off her shiny new 1.5-liter water bottle. "Look at this, Rex!" she exclaimed, holding it up for me to see.

"That’s... HUGE! But why are you showing it to me?", I raised an eyebrow, curious about her enthusiasm and also knowing fully well what it meant.

"Simple," she said with a mischievous grin. "I feel I don’t drink enough water during the day. So why not get a bigger bottle. I will take it easy at the beginning and only finish it one more refill during the classes."

I laughed, assuming she was joking. "Yeah, right. If your intake is ‘NOT-ENOUGH’ then this is like drinking a lake.” I pointed towards her ever-present bulge.

“Well, you can try and keep up with me, Mr. jealous,” She playfully shook my puny 1 litre bottle and sat next to me. But as the morning progressed, it became clear she was dead serious. Kriti was drinking steadily from her new bottle, taking big gulps whenever she had a chance. All my efforts of training myself was getting washed away in front of my eyes and without thinking much, I started doing the same.

By the time our second lecture rolled around, her bottle was already half empty and mine was gone completely too.

"Kriti, are you really trying to drink that much?" I asked, unable to hide my amazement and my own rising desperation.

She nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely. It’s already starting to catch up. God! I love the rush."

"Don’t you think you might reach your limits too soon?" I pointed out.

“Limits?” She shrugged, her eyes sparkling with determination. "I don’t have any. Chill. Besides I don’t like how empty my bladder feels right now" She patted her bulge, which seemed to have grown moderately. On the other hand, my back had started to hurt with the bucket load of piss I was holding in. From the corner of my eyes, I glanced at her smart watch. It had a timer running, which read 18 hours. I couldn’t believe it. For the first time in my life, I was holding more than her – 24 hours.

As I revelled in joy, she continued to drink like a machine. Few lines of note followed by a large swig. She was emptying her bottle at an alarming rate. By lunchtime, she had finished her first refill, just like mine but half-a-litre extra. We grabbed lunch together, and with it came tall glasses of fruit juice. I was doing mental math to estimate my intake when she gingerly kept three water bottles on the tables. I looked at her quizzically,

“The big ones mine, obviously. Then I refilled your tiny 1 litre bottle as well. And this one – This 2 litre one is a gift for you. If you want to keep up, you better match my pace.” She threw me an open challenge to me.

“How did you know I was trying to hold it?”

“It’s all over your face and your body, Rex.” She said, not opting to sit.

I feigned a fake smile and started chugging the juice. She did the same. As the cool of the water hit my bladder I winced and stood up. That’s when my eyes fell on her clenched butt. Even her legs were pressed tightly together, and her posture was rather stiff. The waistband of her shorts dug into her bulge, and beads of sweat formed glistened on her forehead. As she continued to blabber about random stuff, I asked her point blank, "Kriti, isn't all this water catching up with you?" I asked, trying to gain a psychological advantage on her.

"I feel like I am back at school.” She took a big sip of her juice and smiled nonchalantly. “I am getting fuller way faster than I anticipated, but why do you ask?"

"You look a bit uncomfortable." I answered, trying to keep my voice level.

“Do I?” Her brows furrowed. She quickly took out a hand-held mirror from her bag and checked her face. It was clammy. A few strands of hair clung to her forehead and face slightly red. “I will be right back.” She ran to towards the ladies restroom nearby. I assumed that she decided to finally relieve herself in a split second but no! She returned to the table after a while her face looking much fresher. My eyes fell on her belly. She put on a belt and my goodness! IT WAS TIGHT, tight enough to compress her bulge significantly. “Doesn’t it hurt?” I pointed towards it.

“Well, I can still go two notches down.” She winked at me and gingerly sat down. “Honestly, I don’t care about the pain Rex. I must look perfect, and I hate it if someone even thinks that I need to pee. But this weakness deserves a punishment and I'm going to finish at two more refills before the classes end.”

She was surely not joking. Right from the get-go, her lips were on the bottle. I could hear her loud gulps as she continued sipping from her bottle. Unlike the rest of the class, I was squinting my eyes to look at her mind-bendingly calm face. As I glanced further down, I saw that her bladder jutting out solidly, despite that tight belt. It reached up to her belly button. “Rex, stop ogling at me and finish your water.” She commanded without even looking at me. I hurriedly obeyed and started matching up with her.

For the remainder of the session, she maintained her cheerful demeanor and continued to pay full attention to the class, asking questions and even deliver a presentation. I could see the strain starting to show on her body language just like mine. She would involuntarily bring her legs close together and sat upright. She would let out a small grunt whenever she realized it and switch back to casual positions, which made it more difficult to hold. By the second break, I had finished my 2-litre gift from her and her bottle was nearly empty again. When she got up from her seat to get her third refill I grabbed her arm, "Kriti, are you sure this is a good idea?" I whispered, genuinely worried.

"Absolutely," she replied, "You saw what happened during the lunch break. I must train harder, and I want you to keep up with me.”

"But tell me, honestly, how are you feeling now?" I asked, half-expecting her to finally admit she needed to ease off.

"Half-full," she admitted, a playful smile dancing on her lips. "I know I can contain more than this."

As the day wore on, Kriti's bladder grew more and more distended. And so did mine. When she was not looking at me, I held my breath and squeezed my thing through my pocket. All my weeks of training didn’t prepare me for this onslaught of water. I envied a few guys who left to use the bathroom mid-session. Following them, I overheard some of the girls whisper to Kriti that they needed to pee and if she would like to come. Kriti agreed to go with them. “Are you really going?” I grabbed her hand tight enough to crush it. “I can go whenever I want, Rex,” She sternly told me and pulled out her hand. I felt a lump in my throat, and I could watch her walk out like a submissive partner. Her butt cheeks wiggled under that tight fabric. Once outside the door she turned to look at me and held her ears. “I am sorry, but I can’t hold it anymore.” She mouthed to me and walked off.

When she returned to the class she was all smiles and giggles. Her bulge smaller. Her movements fluid and her face stoic.

“You really gave up, didn’t you?” I asked her disappointed.

“I don’t know what came over me. As soon as they invited me to come I felt like I would burst right then.” She apologized.

Hardly an hour was left for the session to end. And I couldn’t help by keep an eye on her. Maybe it was my imagination, but I felt behind her smile, behind her impeccable makeup, her eyes gave away her desperation. They seemed as if they were looking for something. I felt that her goofy antics were more forced than natural. But Kriti being Kriti, seemed unfazed.

By the time our last lecture ended, Kriti had drained her bottle – the third refill. I on the other hand had finished my second bottle as well. I unbuttoned my jeans and heaved a sigh of relief. She swiftly hit my hand. “What do you think you are doing?”

“Why do you care?” I quickly crossed my legs, “You abandoned me. I could tell you feel so relieved already. You don’t even have your bulge.”

"Awww. Big boy is angry with me.” She mocked and sat next to me. “Look at this. It’s on the last notch now. I just took a fake pee.” She held the buckle between her hands and shook it for me. Only then realization struck me. She grinned at me. "I was just teasing you Rex." She then leaned forward to me and buttoned up my jeans again. I winced in pain as pee rushed to the tip of my dick.

After we walked out of the classroom together, she turned to me with that familiar glint in her eye. "How about a movie? There's a new thriller playing that I've been dying to see," she suggested, her voice light and cheerful despite the obvious strain her body was under. Her watch read 29 hours now. And I was at 35.

"Sure, why not?" I squeaked. I knew she was not going easy on herself, but if she was determined to see this through, I was prepared to suffer as well. As I booked the tickets over the phone, she quickly refilled our bottles. Her 4th refill! We made our way to the movie theatre, her lips never resting. Either she would sip, away her water or chat and laugh as if nothing was amiss. When we reached the entrance, the guard stopped us and pointed to Kriti's water bottle. "No outside drinks allowed. You'll have to throw that away."

Kriti’s eyes widened for a moment, but then she smiled. "No problem." She opened the cap and, to my astonishment, began chugging the entire contents of the bottle. I watched in awe as she downed the entire 1.5 litres of water without pausing for breath, then shoved the empty bottle back into her bag with a triumphant grin. She then looked at me expectantly. Unlike her, it took me a while to force down that extra litre. My bladder burnt from inside and dick painfully swollen.

"Ready to go?" she asked, as if we hadn't just added another significant load to our already overburdened bladders.

"Where are you storing all that water?” I couldn’t resist asking hoping to hear some secret trick.

“Right where it is supposed to be?” She squeezed her grotesque bulge. Her belt and the button on her shorts were fighting for their life. Her skin was bruised red under the rough inseams of the shorts.

As the movie started, I kept glancing over at Kriti, watching for any signs of distress. It didn't take long for her discomfort to become apparent. Her body was tense, and she was gently rocking back and forth. Every few minutes, her legs would cross and then uncross, her fingers tapping lightly on her knee. She was clearly trying to distract herself from the growing pressure in her bladder.

"Kriti, how are you holding up?" I teased her, leaning closer, "Is the movie distracting enough?”

She shot me an offended look, her eyes narrowing. "Rex, I DON’T PEE! You really think I can’t hold it?” she hissed back, her voice low but firm. "I just showed that during the classes. I'm going to order a large Coke, for both of us and let’s see who can stay dry."

Before I could protest or pacify her, she flagged down a theatre attendant and ordered the biggest Coke they had. A chill went down my spine as we were served the giant glasses. She started sipping on it immediately and instructed me to do the same. Reluctant but prideful, I chugged that monstrosity of coke. We both were shuddering as the movie progressed, me more than her. But we held our ground. Her face and body told two different stories. She still laughed at all the jokes from the movie or whisper-screamed when a bullet was fired. On the other hand, her legs were tensed and crossed tightly. She tugged in her fingers from time to time to adjust the shorts which dug in mercilessly into her bulge.

When the movie finally ended, her bulge could not even be looked at. It seemed as if she was wearing some sort of prosthetic. It looked so un-natural on her tits-on-stick figure. Her movements were slow, and she had to ask me to pull her up from her seat. Yeah, she was that heavy. I could see the effort it took for her to fight the pressure inside. As we were wiggling out of the row, I heard the sound of fabric getting snapped. I turned around to see her belt tore off, followed by the button of her shorts. “Fuck!” She gasped and collapsed on the seat. Her shorts were wide open now. Her bulge popped out like the airbags from a steering. Thankfully she had a thong inside or else. I expected her to shove her hand in her crotch immediately, but the opposite happened,

“Did you see that?” Her eyes were welled up with happiness. I fucking did it!” She hugged me tightly. I suppressed my scream as my bladder got squeezed under her solidity. She totally forgot that I was holding it too.

We walked back to the dorms in silence. My heart was racing under pressure, under arousal and what not. Despite that boiler like pressure inside her, she walked faster than me, without stopping even once. When we finally reached her dorm, she broke the silence.

"Rex, I know throughout the day a lot happened between us. And I have seen you keep up with me. I don’t know how long have you been hold.. .”

“42 HOURS!” I cut her mid-sentence, forcing to stand with my legs apart. I saw her eyes widen with surprise. She placed her hand on my bulge. “That is HUGE! Like you are hiding a bowling ball inside your pants.”

“You think so?” I forced a smile.

“I think you are the only one who can keep up with me.. .” There was just a centimeter of gap between me and her lips. “It’ s going to be so exciting in the next few days.”

“What do you mean? Are you still not going to pee?” My face turned pale.

“Rex, I can’t. It’s 12.30AM, Tuesday already.” She pursed her lips, “I may have considered a partial pee before bed, but I noticed the time just now. So be strong for me and meet me on Wednesday.” Kriti kissed me passionately and headed off inside.

I was shaking but I steeled myself to hold it all night. The damned Wednesday just couldn't come any faster.
