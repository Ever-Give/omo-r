This was a terrific story! Wonderfully descriptive! I adore the idea of a family tradition where the women have to wait until the end of the day to pee! I also love the aspect that everyone will know automatically if she goes and she can't even lie about it. Beautifully written! I love the imagery most of all!!!

I can't express how much your comment has inspired me to write more! All the aspects which you highlighted were put into the story after much deliberation. I am so happy that it is being appreciated 😊

Yana has a twin sister? How interesting.

I'm sure she has younger sisters as well, and I bet they are intensely competetive with the two elder siblings.

Sounds like grandma's diuretics will go missing at the family funtion. Or something along those lines. 😉

I don't mean to bother you. But are you currently working on the Lollipop chainsaw omorashi Story or are you taking a little break before you start writing

Hey buddy.. No you're not bothering me... Don't worry. There are a few pending commission works which I need to deliver. Currently working on those... The chainsaw story will take some time
