I too want to write it quickly but the patron is yet to give his final verdict on the closure. That's why it's taking a while 😭

Heloooooooooo my lovely omo lovers! I bring to you the last part of this story. Witness Kriti's absolute desperation and Rex's solidarity. Read on!

The Meltdown:

As I forced myself to go to bed I wondered why Kriti said that she would meet me directly on Wednesday and not Tuesday morning. I dropped her a text but there was no response. The radio silence from her and the pressure - they didn’t let me sleep at all. I hadn’t relieved myself since two full days and now the weight of it had settled in my lower abdomen like a stone. But it wasn’t just the fullness biting at me—it was pride and my insane crush on her. I had to hold it, had to keep up with her. It was 9AM in the morning – 48 hours since I allowed myself a single drop of relied.

I was writhing in the bed trying to find a comfortable position when there was a knock at the door—rapid, insistent. I shuffled over, wincing at the ache spreading through my abdomen with each step. When I opened it, there she was: Kriti, standing in the doorway, her arms wrapped tightly around her middle, her face pale with concentration. She wasn’t smiling like usual, not today. She was just dressed in an oversized hoodie, though it barely reached her crotch. Fortunately, she had a tight little thong under, to cover herself.

“R-Rex” she said, her voice slightly strained. “I… I need your help. Anchoring practice. Dance… I mean, I need to… just… practice.” She swallowed, shifting her weight from one foot to the other, her legs squeezing together as if trying to fuse into one. I stared at her. “You good?” I asked, my own voice shaky, more from the pressure building inside me than anything else.

She nodded, her lips pressed tight. “Totally… fine. It’s Tuesday, you know.”

Right. Tuesday. As if I would forget her rule. She stood there, a grotesque bulge visible just under her top, her belly taut, her breaths shallow. I could see the sheen of sweat on her forehead, and her fingers tapped nervously against her leg. She wasn’t fine, not at all.

“Sure,” I managed, stepping aside to let her in. I kept my own movements slow, deliberate, but the truth was, every step felt like a mini battle not to lose control.

Kriti shuffled inside, immediately making a beeline for my chair. She sat down heavily, legs crossing, then uncrossing, her foot tapping incessantly against the floor. She glanced at me, noticing my discomfort. “You… alright?” she asked, though her voice was barely more than a whisper. Her hand hovered near her belly, fingers twitching slightly as if fighting the urge to press down.

I exhaled slowly, nodding. “Yeah. You?”

“Never b-been better. Yeah…” she trailed off, biting her lip, her eyes darting toward the window, as if looking for some form of distraction. Her entire body seemed to be in constant motion now, her hips shifting, her legs squeezing together, then spreading apart slightly, only to clamp together again a second later.

We both knew the real reason she was here, but neither of us wanted to admit it. She was avoiding her own bathroom, avoiding the temptation of finally giving in. But the longer she stayed, the more obvious it became that she was fighting a losing battle. And so was I.

“So… uh, dance practice?” I suggested, more to break the silence than anything else.

Kriti swallowed hard, her hand gripping the edge of my desk now. “Yeah, right. Dance.” She stood up, or rather, she tried to. Her legs wobbled as she straightened, her hand instinctively pressing against the bulge in her lower abdomen. She let out a shallow breath, blinking rapidly. The sheer weight must have felt like a boulder.

“Maybe… maybe not dancing,” she mumbled, sitting back down quickly. Her face was flushed now, and she wiped the sweat from her brow, her breathing noticeably faster. “I, uh, think we should… focus on the lines.”

I nodded, though the throbbing in my own bladder made it hard to concentrate. Sitting down on the bed, I tried to keep my legs still, but they bounced up and down on their own accord. Every few minutes, I had to adjust my position, hoping it would take some of the pressure off. It didn’t. Kriti kept her eyes on the script in front of her, but I could see her struggle. Her legs were crossed so tightly, it was a wonder she hadn’t snapped something. Her hands rested in her lap, fingers curled into fists as she tried to maintain some semblance of control. But I saw her shifting more often, her back arching slightly as if trying to ease the tension in her bladder.

“Kriti? Please tell me you can still keep yourself corked up!?” I asked quietly, unable to bear the tension any longer.

She turned to me, her eyes wide, her lips trembling. For a second, I thought she might admit defeat, but then she swallowed hard and forced a smile. “Of-of course,” she said, though her voice wavered. “I… I’ve done this before. No problem.” But there was no confidence in her words, no bravado like usual. Her whole body was trembling now, her foot tapping rhythmically on the floor. Her legs were pressed so tightly together, it looked like she was trying to merge them into one. I couldn’t take my eyes off her bulge. That poor thong was fighting for its life, stretched to the limits. Her breathing was shallow, her boobs heaving and falling quickly as if she were trying to keep it together through sheer willpower.

“Maybe… maybe we should get some brunch?” I suggested, my voice cracking slightly. I wasn’t even sure I could stand without losing control at this point, but the thought of staying here, in this tension, was unbearable. Kriti nodded quickly, her eyes darting toward the door. “Yeah. sounds… good.” I quickly brushed my teeth and returned to my room. She looked at me with contempt assuming that I rushed for a pee. Without saying a word, I took my T-shirt off to change it. My jutted bulge silenced her worries at one go.

We then made our way to the cafeteria. Kriti’s face was dripping with sweat and her legs were refusing to take more than a few steps. The passerby looked at us with amazement as we trudged on. My dick hurt and my butt was going numb with all the non-stop clenching. I could feel my bladder throbbing and I knew Kriti was in no better shape. She walked with her legs close together, her body tense, her hand hovering near her belly as if she was fighting her primal needs to grab herself. At the cafeteria, she ordered a large iced-tea, much to my disbelief. I stared at her as she took a long sip, the straw slipping between her lips as if she hadn’t already consumed a lake’s worth of liquids.

“Where are you going to put all that juice, Kriti?” I asked, half-joking, half-terrified as I bought the same juice with some other stuff.

She shot me a sideways glance, her eyes narrowing. “My..My bladder,” she snapped, though her voice was tight. “It will st-stretch. It always d-does, especially on Tuedays.” But even as she said it, her hand tightly gripped her thighs, and I could sense her legs were twitching under the table. The pressure must have been torturous, and yet she kept drinking - not just the tea but another bottle of water too, as if determined to prove something to herself. Or to me.

On our way back, she paused every few steps. It was hard for me to watch her squirming. Till yesterday Kriti could take on the world with a full bladder but now she could barely walk a few steps. If somebody filmed us they would think we were playing a weird game of sitting on every damn bench alongside the pathway. By the time we got back to my room, she was shaking. In those 30 seconds that took me to open the door, Kriti’s condition had rapidly worsened. I turned back and found her kneeling on the floor with her grip piercing her thighs. Her head hung low, and she rocked back and forth. Her whole life was now dependent of keeping her pee in.

I helped her to stand up and carried her inside. Once the door was shut, something broke inside Kriti. She yelped in despair and curled up on the bed.

“Kriti… You haven’t gone for 45 hours?” I held her tight.

Kriti let out a shaky breath, her legs crossing tightly. “Nope. I can…hold… fine… I’m fine,” she whispered, but the way her voice trembled told a different story.

“Then why is there a wet dot on your thong?” I circled her pussy with my fingers. God! My heart was racing.

“Noooo! It can’t be…” Kriti finally shoved her hand in her crotch. “I – I’m so sorry. It never happens.. Stupid bladder…I won’t pee, trust me” She was so apologetic about it. I expected her to go easy on herself at that point but no! She did the exact opposite. She grabbed a bottle and chugged it down. “This…punish my bladder…for weakness.” I was shocked. Her obsession was insane. I could feel my dick harden up immediately. It hurt like hell as desperation and arousal raided the insides of my dick. I felt my bladder tearing apart as I forced myself to match her pace at drinking.

Hours passed, and any chance of practice or dance was out of the window. The tension only grew, and she still fought with tooth and nail to drink more water. We tried to focus on a movie, on anything to distract ourselves, but it was impossible. Kriti’s body was in constant motion now, her legs fidgeting, her hand never leaving her swollen dripping crotch. She barely spoke, only nodding or giving short answers whenever I asked her something. This tension had been building for two days. Neither Kriti nor I had relieved ourselves since Sunday and now, on Tuesday afternoon, the pressure was agonizing.

My bladder felt like it was going to explode, but I couldn’t let go—not before Kriti. She was always stronger, always able to hold longer, and I couldn’t bring myself to give up. Kriti was writhing next to me on the bed, her legs knotted tightly and her hand gripping her swollen crotch for life. pressed against her swollen abdomen. Her usual “I-CAN-HOLD-NO-MATTER-WHAT” attitude had faded, replaced by a nervous energy that she was struggling to hide. I could tell she was at her breaking point, but she hadn’t said a word about it yet. She was too proud to admit it.

“Rex,” she whispered suddenly, breaking the silence. Her voice was soft, almost trembling. “I’m really sorry. I… I didn’t think it would get this bad.” She didn’t meet my eyes, her focus entirely on the growing discomfort in her bladder. She was rocking vigorously, trying to find some position that might ease the pressure. Looking at her was making me weak. As a man, I would never grab myself in front of a girl and certainly not in front of my crush.

“Kriti...”I asked, “Tell me honestly, why did you come to my room this morning?” I managed to ask, my voice strained.

“We’ve… we’ve done this before. We’ll get through it.”

Kriti let out a shaky breath, her legs squeezing together tighter. “I don’t know, Rex,” she murmured, her eyes darting toward the door, the temptation clearly weighing on her. “I… I don’t think I’ve ever had to go this bad ….and since we returned…. to the hostels last night…. I was getting weak...It was getting difficult… to resist the temptation of going to the toilet…” I could feel the tension in her voice, and it sent a chill down my spine.

“I knew…you…would not...pee…and you are …the only man who…can help..” Kriti never admitted desperation, not like this. If she was struggling, then I knew we were both in trouble.

“You’re still in control,” I said, trying to sound reassuring, even though my own bladder was screaming at me. “You’ve held it this long. You can keep going.” She nodded weakly, biting her lip, but her body was betraying her. Her thighs pressed together with a desperation that she couldn’t hide anymore, and every few seconds, she shifted uncomfortably, as though the pressure inside her was becoming unbearable. “I’ve …never broken my rule before,” she whispered, almost to herself. “I like…this feeling…I’ve never peed on a Tuesday.” Her voice cracked, and for the first time.

“And you won’t,” I said quickly, trying to keep the panic out of my voice. “I don’t want you to pee Kriti. Just breathe.”

“You …really don’t?” I saw her eyes twinkle.

“Yes and neither will I…”I straightened up.

Looking at me she too steeled herself to pull her hands away from her crotch, but I could tell she was on the verge of losing it. The bulge in her abdomen seemed like a huge watermelon was hidden under her skin. The fabric of her thong was pressing or rather squeezing into her dripping labia. It looked painful, and I couldn’t imagine how she was still managing to hold it in. We sat there in silence, both of us too tense to speak. The pressure in my own bladder was killing me, and every minute that passed felt like torture. I clenched my fists, trying to focus on anything other than the overwhelming need to pee.

I couldn’t let myself show weakness, not when Kriti was fighting so hard. In that moment something happened, Kriti crawled closer to me and climbed on my lap, wrapping her legs around me. I could fee her body shake as the strain on her sphincter shot through the roof. She quickly unzipped her hoodie to let out the heat and I had her gigantic sweaty boobs, right in my face. I swear I could cum more load than I had in my bladder. I was turning blue with the effort of clenching my dick. Kriti’s hot breathing fell right on my neck. She held my tightly, groaning right in my ear.

But the more time passed, the worse it got. Kriti’s movements became more frantic, her body trembling slightly as she fought to stay in control. Her legs were squeezing against my waist and she was practically bouncing on my lap, unable to stay still. Every few seconds, she would let out a quiet, shaky breath. She shoved one hand into her crotch and her knuckles pressed right into my bladder. I winced In pain.

“Sorry…sorry Rex,” she whispered, her voice cracking with guilt. “I… I didn’t mean to...”

“Kriti, stop,” I said, my voice strained but firm. “You don’t have to apologize. We’re in this together.”

She nodded, but I could see the tears welling up in her eyes. “I just… I don’t want to pee..but I don’t know how much longer I can last. It’s… it’s so bad, Rex. I’m bursting.. so full.”

Her words sent a shiver down my spine, and I realized how close she was to giving in. But I couldn’t let her. Not yet.

“We’ve held it for two days,” I said, trying to sound confident. “What’s a few more hours?”

She let out a bitter laugh, her body shaking with the effort to hold on. “A few more hours?” she echoed, her voice filled with disbelief. “I can barely last a few more minutes.” Despite her words, she was still holding it in, still fighting with everything she had. I admired her strength, but I could see the cracks in her resolve. Her body was trembling, and her breaths were laboured. All the water was caught up now. My muscles down there were spasming and my dick was throbbing. By evening, the tension in the room was suffocating. Kriti was no longer trying to hide her desperation. She was on the edge she started grinding. I was having the hardest and the HARDEST time of my life. Her face was pale, her eyes wide with panic.

“Rex,” she whimpered, her voice barely audible. “I don’t… think I can do this.”

“Yes, you can,” I said, though I wasn’t sure if I was trying to convince her or myself. “We will not pee till it’s Wednesday…”My own bladder felt like it was going to burst, and every second was agony, but I couldn’t give in. Not when she was holding on. Evening came and went and our bladders continued to swell as we refused to cut down on water.

But as we approached midnight, Kriti was unsure. “I’m scared,” she admitted, her voice trembling. “I’m leaking… Rex...”

I lifted her in my arms, my legs half-numb after being seated for so long and laid her on my bed. Her thong had a coin sized patch now. “How … are you holding …?” She managed to ask.

“I am f-fine. If you are h-holding. So will I..” I moved closer and smooched her. She passionately smooched be back. It was a hot moment. Had it not been for our precarious situation we would have fucked each other’s brains out. A few minutes into the kiss, Kriti pushed me back and her hands flew to her crotch. She could not stop another spurt from leaking out.

“Please…Don’t pee! We are almost there..” I whispered to her. She was panicking, and I could see the internal battle she was fighting.

“I’m trying Rex..”Her body was screaming for relief, but her mind refused to let her give in. She looked at me with anger in her eyes suddenly and asked me to pass a bottle of water. I obliged. “Punishment…my bladder.” I got what she said and downed one myself.

“W-why are you…drinking Rex?”

“Because…I love you Kriti…” I finally confessed. “I want to hold for you like a man!”

And that was it.

Kriti could no longer hold herself back. She pushed me into the bed and tore away her clothes. Her breathing turned into a full-blown panting as she landed right on top of my bladder and started grinding. Given her situation Kriti was still shuddering as she forced herself to pleasure me and in the process her floodgates open. “Nooooooo!” She screamed as her pee gurgled out. It was not warm – it was literally HOT. Her eyes rolled up – nails pierced into my chest – she drooled, and her moans of pleasure echoed throughout my room. The gurgle and the blob of her outburst sent shivers through my belly.

It flattened my belly as she kept on gushing out. 57 hours’ worth of pee and countless litres of water were stored inside her poor bladder and not it pushed out with fury. Her pent-up pee spread all over my belly, my chest. My chest, my clothes everything was drenched. I craned my neck and found that it formed a huge puddle on the floor and spread everywhere. “I – I couldn’t do ..it without you ..Rex. You are MY MAN!” She stopped midstream, as if to prepare herself for another round and BAM! Another round of pee erupted through her nether splattering all over for the next 4 minutes till she was completely empty to the last drop.

“Rex, I’m yours!” She said with a seductive voice as she snapped out of her desperation. With the load on her bladder eliminated she was back. The way she felt through my wet clothes was simply inexplicable. I felt my throat dry up. I felt a tremble between my legs. My manhood was erect with all it’s might and ready to gush out. It lifted Kriti up by a good few inch. I gathered all my power and tried to clench down, but the sensory overload was too much. My pee needed out – NOW.

Kriti yanked my jeans and briefs down and tightly grabbed my throbbing manhood. “Let’s FUCK Rex. Peeing can wait till Thursday for you.” And the rest is history!

Just fantastic (as always) Rex🤩

I never be into male desperation before you start to write about it. So hot that Kirti refuse Rex to pee for 2 more days, and that he wil wear jeans all the time.

Would be cool if you wrote a sequal where Kirti has trained her bladder to beat Rex and outhold him

}}

Do you know bud how big this appreciation is! I can't stop thinking about it. If I truly got you into reading about male omo despite you not preferring it is surely a big achievement for me. You made my day! Thank you so much buddy 🥹

As of now I don't know about the sequel but never say never ❤️
