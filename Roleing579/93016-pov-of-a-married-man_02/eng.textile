Our street now had a show stopper. Cars were slowing down as they passed, teenagers were creating reels in our front yard, and a few neighbours, who until this point we had no clue of, were now making small talks. It's weird how things change when an RV is parked in our front yard. Nicole hated the attention, and you know me, I find the idea of being the centre of attention distasteful. Nevertheless, this didn’t dampen the spirit of our vacation.

From a week prior to our departure, our preparations commenced in full swing. We Made several trips to the town, making sure to buy everything that was needed for our week’s adventure. “It feels so weird… This will be the first time we will be travelling without making any kind of hotel bookings…” said Nicole, while we were returning from the supermarket.

The backseat of our sedan was crammed with bags. At the start of the week, we managed to buy all the equipment and tools that would come handy during our road trip. Umbrellas, tent, kitchen utensils, water dispenser, toilet paper, Swiss Knife, cutter…

We decided to buy food items the night before, so that they remain fresh through the journey. Our latest shopping involved fruits, vegetables, frozen meat, snacks, juices, alcohol, cigarettes, rolling paper (we both smoke up 😉 ), and toiletries that would come handy. “I know… it’s gonna be a very new experience. I am sure we’ll learn a few things, and I have a gut feeling that it won’t be all that bad” I respond.

Usually, it would take us about 30 mins to reach back home. But that evening, it was rush hour. We slowed down, and came to a halt, behind a trail of cars, crawling ahead of us.

We’d kind of expected this, sometimes you just kind of get used to stuff. Like, you order something, and there’s delay. You expect your day at work to be easy going, and it turns out to be crazier than ever. You know, that kind of stuff. But there are times when things catch me completely off guard. And it’s those moments that make life a whole lot interesting.

“Will my gut has other feelings” said Nicole, backing it up with a blush, and looking away. “Other feelings?” I ask, unable to make sense of it right away. “Uh huh” she said, and it was then it hit me. The car, which until now smelled of our lemon based air freshener, changed to something else altogether. Not only did Nicole push out a silent toot, she even mentioned it in the cutest way possible.

To give a small context, not much had happened post that eventful night. But my shady business hadn’t stopped. Now that my wife knew what my fetish was, I didn’t feel guilty checking out Nicole’s pantie in the laundry. One thing that struck me right away was the fact that Nicole was a good wiper. Her knickers never had any kind of brown stains. But, she was a leaker for sure. Most times, her panties had stains, and on rare occasions, they were slightly damp.

“I hope your gut has more such feelings” I said, acknowledging her naughty act. She gave me this incredibly naughty grin, and looked away. As fate had it, we came to a complete stand still. “Alright mister, it’s time to talk about a few things…” she said, looking confident now. “See, I know you love the idea of me doing dirty stuff, and I’ve given it enough of a thought, and guess what, I am open to exploring it”. She explained calmly.

My gaze shifted between the windshield ahead, and Nicole. A small part of me knew that this talk was around the corner. “That’s just fantastic babe…” I told her, moving the car slightly ahead and the traffic began to ease out. “I was meaning to talk to you about it too. However, I wanted to give you some space. But I love what I am hearing… go on, don’t stop now” I tease, driving at a decent pace.

Nicole matched my energy, unable to contain her infectious giggles. “I’ve been doing some research, it’s… wait… omor… umm… fuck, yeah! Omorashi, right? Your lil kink?” She asked. I was dumbfounded, that word… It was the first time I heard someone say it aloud, I mean in person. “Yeah, that’s what it’s called” I responded sheepishly, “What kind of research did you do?”, I asked, as I drove through the madness ahead, and had a breakthrough, it was this other route that I was familiar with.

“I saw a couple of videos, read a few stories and I am pretty surprised love, there are a ton of communities where people talk about it, pretty mainstream your lil kink is” she said, opening up naturally. I was impressed, and my mind tried to figure out all kinds of stuff she would have encountered.

“It’s my guilty pleasure” I tell her. “At times, I check out videos, and look up stories… and you know… have fun” I chuckle. Much like all married folks out there, Nicole and I watch porn. Sometimes together, and at times alone. No hush hush in that department. “I honestly wasn’t a big fan of the staged stuff. Those models have no idea how to act, and it seemed so forced!” Said Nicole. “But damn, the real ones, as in the amateur category, were super hot” she giggled.

“I am not much into the staged stuff either. But there’s this one particular series… It's extremely nonchalant. Like these two models casually have a smoke, and start peeing in their living room. Like it’s one of the most casual things to do. I find the incredibly arousing” I tell her, letting her in on what I enjoy the most.

“Well, that does sound fun. I think the appeal is the naughtiness right? The forbidden aspect. I’ve been trying to make sense of it… like when I squatted in our living room and did number two, my mind was all over the place. I know I was not supposed to do that. My entire body resisted it. But despite that, when I pushed, and forced myself, I felt aroused. The rebel inside me awakened” she said, going into details of her 2 cents to the whole incident.

“Tell me something love, is it just watching, or do you like going in your clothes too? Because I read quite a few experiences of guys who enjoy that” she asked. We were about 10 mins out from our place. I drove at a comfortable speed, calmly overtaking slow moving vehicles. “I’ve experimented a few times…” I tell Nicole. “But… um… doing it alone was no fun” I tell her honestly.

“Hmm… alright. That can change tonight” she said, giving me that “Yep, we’re gonna have some fun tonight” look. I didn’t say much, my expression and the bulge between my legs did all the talking. I parked the car beside the RV, and stepped out. “Given the normal circumstances, I’d bolt inside and take care of my business, but that ain’t happening tonight” she said, keeping things subtle. I loved it when Nicole took control of things. Neither of us were into that dom/ sub dynamics, what I mean to say is my wife taking the lead is something I find incredibly hot.

“So here’s the plan. We start packing, and loading the RV up. That would take us about an hour. Once done, we head in, shower, finish our dinner, and sleep. Until the point of having a shower, the bathroom's off limits. We either hold, or warm things up. Sounds like a plan?” She asked, with both hands on her hip. Without wanting a second, I took her in my arms, and kissed Nicole. No soft touch of lips, hardcore pushing my tongue in kind of stuff. “Fuck, you are the best!” I compliment before letting her go.
