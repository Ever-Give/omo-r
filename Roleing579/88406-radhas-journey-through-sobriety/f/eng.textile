Hey everyone, here’s a context to this story series. It’s kind of inspired from my own journey of quitting alcohol with the help of support groups, and finding my own ways to stay sober. This idea has been running in my mind for a while now, so I have gone ahead and started writing.

If it seems interesting, I’d be more than happy to continue. The character and location is based out of India. But as I’d be writing mostly to a global audience, I’ll limit the usage of regional language. If I feel like the situation demands it, I’ll add in translation. So here it goes, do let me know your thoughts on this 🙂

Chapter One - Her First AA Meeting

“I am Radha, and I am an alcoholic” introduced a woman, as 15 people seated around her echoed “Hey Radha!” cheerfully. Convincing herself to share at a meeting felt very challenging. Intrusive thoughts “Maybe the next meeting”, “No one will be interested to hear you”, “what if you stammer, and go blank”, played like a negative campaign in her mind, as she boiled in her own misery. But Radha found that courage, a tiny ray of motivation that stopped the madness in her head, and put things into action.

@@A 35 year old woman, dressed in a beautiful saree, straight long hair, was Radha. Who was about to share for the first time at an Alcohol Anonymous meeting. “Hey everyone, um.. I’ve been away from alcohol for 60 days now… and…” before she continued, people in the meeting began to applaud. At first, it made Radha anxious, but her gaze that was fixated on the floor, slowly met the people who genuinely seemed happy for her. Her lips broke into a soft smile, as she waited for them to stop. “Thank you….” She uttered, and continued “The last few days haven’t been easy. The cravings have been intense. There were nights when I almost went ahead and brought home some beer” she said, pausing for a few seconds. “But I don’t know why I didn’t. I really can’t say it was god who stopped me. I just can’t. But from what I have experienced, maybe it was the pain of staying drunk which probably stopped me from buying alcohol” she said, almost like she was talking to herself, and making sense of how things shaped out. “Nonetheless, the good thing is that I didn’t drink. It feels nice to be here. Among you all. I’ve never really had relationships with people who seemed genuinely happy for me. It’s always like they needed something or the other, for them to you know… be around me. So yeah, 60 days!” She said, forcing herself to be motivated, and said “Thank you all for listening, you guys are awesome” she said, and again, the room was filled with applause and assuring nods coming from the men and women, who shared the space.

As the cheering continued, Radha smiled and sat in her seat. Feeling a lot lighter, from whatever she managed to share. Under her saree, she crossed her legs. Muting the desperation to pee. Ever since she’d quit alcohol, her obsessive personality had moved towards food and sex. She had no idea why hunger and lust had taken over her mind and body. Radha had started to order 3 times a day. Loading her cabinet with munchies, biscuits and chocolates. Apart from that, her meals were heavy, from biryani to pork ribs, pizzas to rolls, all she did was scan places on her phone, and order in.

Apart from that, Radha had found touching herself far too many times a day. The sensations were too intense, almost like when she had first discovered the pleasure during her teens. To add on, her long lost fetish, the joy she’d experience leaking pee into her clothes had returned. During her days of drinking, there was hardly any time when Radha kept her panties dry. Either she’d delay her visit to the bathroom and leak, or at home, would be too drunk and let nature flow into her clothes. However, the feeling wasn’t the same in sobriety. The decision to leak in her pantie would be a conscious one. Which she was planning on experimenting someday soon.

Radha, cross legged, sat and heard a few sharing more, and before the closing prayer, she excused herself and walked out of the meeting. Her social anxiety got the best of her, and while she began walking to her car, she stopped. “I’ve not only made it to a meeting, but also shared. Why am I running away now?” She thought to herself, and lit a smoke. “Maybe I could do a quick round of hellos, doesn’t seem all that difficult” she contemplated, and stood outside the meeting, awaiting the members to step out.

Chapter Two - Socialising

Half way through her smoke, a distant sound of people laughing, and chatting away was heard. Radha stubbed the cigarette, and exhaled the last drag quickly. Her heartbeat increased, as the collective noise got closer. “Just leave, you don’t have to do this!” Was the thought dominating Radha’s mind. Before she could act on it, a slightly older woman, walking beside two other well dressed men appeared, and waved at Radha. Automatically, her hand raised as she waved back. “You should have stayed until the closing prayer. Trust me, we don’t bite” said the older woman, playfully. “Hi, I am Anu, and this is Raghu and Ram”.

Anu was the older woman, in her early 40s, dressed in jeans, a white T-shirt, and slip ons. She had black curly hair, a fair complexion, glowing skin, and great assets. Raghu seemed a lot younger. A man in his late 20s, dressed in formals, who looked like a person making a meeting right after work. Ram on the other hand was older than Anu. At the very first glance, one could say that his presence was slightly intimidating. 6’2 height, branded business formals, neat shoes and well maintained body.

Radha smiled and introduced herself. These people strangely felt very welcoming. This was the first time she was meeting them, and how could they be so friendly. Something is definitely off, thought her mind. “Wanna grab a quick coffee with us? There’s this place we frequent down the road. A nice cafe” said Anu, inviting Radha.

“Sure, I’d be happy to” responded the woman, and Ram said “Sorry guys, need to head home. Wife’s birthday, have to be a part of it”. Anu and Raghu hugged him, and he reached his hand out to Radha, before leaving. “Keep coming back, it works” were his parting words to the newcomer, to which Radha said “I will!”.

@@“So, how’s your day been?” Asked Anu, walking beside Radha. It was 08:00 PM in Bangalore (A city in India, look it up. A fun place to live). Cars, bikes and trucks lined up, resulting in the usual rush hour traffic. “Quite uneventful. I have taken a break from work for a few months, so I have nothing but time to kill” said Radha, summing her day up in one sentence. The need to pee was intensifying, as desperation now came in waves. Radha mentally had planned on driving back home desperate, maybe stop by a MC D drive thru, and leak some pee into her pantie while waiting for her food. But now, things seem different. Here she was, walking beside two people who she'd just met. “Make the best use of it, sometimes uneventful is a good thing” responded Anu warmly. “I remember how difficult my early days were. My mind was all over the place, but it eventually settles. I can assure you that” she added. Radha could feel this instant connection. As in, very weirdly, Anu could understand exactly what she was going through. Being an introvert by nature, Radha didn’t express much at the moment. “Thanks” was all she could muster up to convey.

Raghu was busy sending out a few e-mails on his phone. Very recently, the young man had gotten himself a job at a financial firm. Given the fact that he too was a recovering alcoholic, his obsession and compulsion was centered around work. The need to seek approval from his new boss had led him down a path where he assumed that being available all the time was the right thing to do.

On the corner of the street was a small cafe. Simple decor, well lit environment and less crowd. Anu took the lead, and walked to a table. The waiters greeted the woman, and Raghu. It was clear to Radha that they were regulars here.

“Mere ko na, ek strong black coffee” (I’ll have a strong black coffee) said Anu to the waiter. “Mujhe ek watermelon juice” (I’ll take a watermelon juice), said Raghu and then Radha said “Coffee…”. The waiter took the order, and left their table before serving the three cold water. Radha was crossing her legs real tight. One good thing for her was the sign board which read “Toilet”. Just one coffee, after that I may still be able to execute the plan, she thought and held onto her need.

“What plans for the night?” Asked Anu. Usually, AA came with a hint of toxicity. A few members who’d been in the fellowship for a few years, wore their sobriety like a badge of honour. Power tripping their way through newcomers, ambushing them after the first meeting, and hitting them with the program like a ton of bricks. But when it came to Anu, she was one among the few who would suggest or give a piece of her experience only when asked. She had 10 years of clean time, and was doing pretty good for herself as an entrepreneur.

“Nothing much really… was thinking about grabbing some food and heading home. Probably watch a movie or something and pass out” responded Radha. “Pass out huh? Old usage of words die hard” commented Raghu, in a funny manner. The three of them laughed and the beverages arrived.

Half way through her coffee, Radha could feel her need to pee skirt the danger level. Now, she had two choices, one was to excuse herself and use the washroom. Two, was to hold on, until she was done with her coffee. Then pay the bill, and walk to her car to execute her plan. “What if I just let some out here” a thought crossed her mind. “I am wearing a black saree, a little wouldn’t show for sure” was the next thought which followed. All of this was happening while she was a part of this conversation involving early recovery.

The excitement of doing something this lewd encompassed Radha. “I can so relate about food! I have no idea why I’ve been eating so heavily lately. I just can’t seem to… you know…” she paused and felt warm between her legs “Understand why this is happening!” She said and smiled. Right there in front of two people, Radha had secretly leaked some pee into her pantie. Mentally she started to imagine how big the spot would be on her bright pink knicker. Her nipples grew hard behind the matching bra, as she quickly finished her coffee.

Radha suddenly felt anxious. Negative thoughts flooded in, as she wondered why on earth would she do something like this. Here she was, meeting people who were ready to help and support her, and all she could think of was leaking pee into her panties. “I am kind of getting late. I’ll see you guys tomorrow” said Radha. “Yep, we were leaving too” responded Anu, and called for the check. After the bill was paid, the three parted ways, after a warm hug.

While Radha walked back to the car, she calmed down a bit. The cool air helped in making her feel better. For the past few days, she was having these sudden anxiety attacks. She knew that they were short term withdrawals. Now in the silence that lingered inside the car, she took a few deep breaths, and looked at her lap. A beautiful saree appeared covering every inch of her skin. The lust took over again. She bit her lips softly and eased her bladder. Despite the fact that she needed to pee, she couldn’t. Somehow her muscles could not let go. Smiling to herself, Radha started the vehicle and drove out of the parking lot.

A LATE NIGHT DRIVE, AND RECOLLECTIONS.

Upon entering the main intersection, Radha smoothly brought her car to a halt. While waiting for the single to turn green, she noticed the time on her infotainment system. Realizing it was still too early to head home, her mind contemplated places that she could be at. Bars were clearly out of question, she wasn’t all that hungry to stop by a restaurant, and her attention span was too screwed to sit through an entire movie at the theatre. “Probably, I could just drive out for a while, grab another coffee by the highway and head home” she thought. With that, the lights turned green, and the constant honking from behind was heard. “Holy fuck, I am moving! What’s the rush!” she mumbled, and drove ahead.

Bangalore’s airport was located in its outskirts. The roads leading to it were in good condition, and mostly free during the night. Apart from the people who’d go to the airport to catch a flight, there were a few who would drive up to enjoy the cool night breeze, grab some coffee while watching aero planes land and take off. Radha did just that. She played her go-to progressive techno set, and cruised through the traffic and entered the freeway.

Her need to pee was now starting to reach a point of serious desperation. Usually, wetting herself came a lot easier when she was under the influence of alcohol. It kind of made her lose the fear of consequence. As she drove, Radha remembered a recent incident that had occurred. A few days before she had decided to quit drinking, there was this really cool party where she was invited to. Open area, psychedelic lights, a promising DJ playing real good music, and alcohol along with other substances that were on the house. Within a short span of time, Radha found herself grooving to the beats, as she was nearing her fourth glass of whiskey. The friend who had invited her to the venue led her to a secluded corner where a joint was lit. Occasionally Radha smoked pot.

Taking a few drags, and sipping some more alcohol, she was in a good space. This is when the “lust monster” something she’d given a unique name to over the years, surfaced. It had been a while since she had peed, and now things were getting dangerously close to her having an accident. Radha looked around, and spotted a nice little area where there was a good amount of grass that had grown, and was slightly away from the crowd. She excused herself politely from the gang she was hanging out with, by saying she needed to have a smoke.

Holding a drink in her hand, she walked up to the spot, and lit a cigarette. That night, she was wearing a shiny black dress that hugged her figure, giving people enough to look at. Her heels pushed her butt further up, grabbing the attention of both men and women. To an onlooker, Radha seemed like a girl who was chilling by herself. The lights were dim, and apart from the strobes that were going crazy, it was quite dark. Taking advantage of this, a long sigh left Radha’s lips. The familiar feeling of warmth was felt between her legs. Her red pantie absorbed the golden fluid, as Radha let out a calculated spurt. It was enough to soak the area of her knicker between her legs, and not drip down her thighs.

Looking around, she noticed people in their own little world. No one was focusing on her specifically. With that, came out another spurt. This time she released her bladder a bit more. The stream was soft, gentle and quiet. Some of her pee landed straight down her legs, and some warmed her thighs. After peeing enough to calm the desperation, Radha stopped her flow and moved away. It took her a few minutes to finish her smoke, and her drink, before she made her way back to her friends. And just like that, Radha took care of the pressing matter, and got back to grooving while her wet pantie pressed against her pussy.

Strangely, recollecting that incident got Radha aroused as she drove. Now on the elevated freeway, her car was cruising at a good speed. “Alright now, let’s do this” she told herself. While her eyes looked ahead, her concentration moved to her bladder. She consciously tried to relax, and though she did that, nothing came out. But the wave of desperation was lingering around. Determined to let a spurt out, she started to contract and release her bladder a few times. Finally, her pantie was greeted with the much awaited warmth. “Holy fuck” she whispered to herself, feeling terribly naughty. She now had complete control of her bladder. Knowing well that the next release would surely turn positive, she relaxed. This time, intentionally pushing out a good amount of pee. The moment she felt the wetness around her butt, she stopped the flow. Thankfully, she was wearing a black sari, the stain would surely seem subtle, she thought.

THE DRIVE CONTINUES…

It didn’t take long for the warm feeling to turn cold. Having had coffee sometime ago, Radha could smell a faint aroma of pee, coming from her. Over the years, she’d gotten accustomed to it. The only time this smell really bothered her was when she woke up drunk at her friend’s place, soaking the bed entirely.

Michell was Radha’s childhood friend. They grew up in the same neighbourhood, studied in the same school, and when it came to college, Radha took up journalism, while Michell aspired to be a chartered accountant.

Seeing Radha drinking heavily had gotten Michell very worried. The initial years were a lot of fun. Sneaking out of home, partying, meeting boys, and in general, having a good time. While Michell limited herself to a drink or two, Radha would often had to be helped out of the pub.

Apart from a few cars, the road ahead was empty. Radha enabled cruise control, and lowered the windows. The cool air breezed in, as she remembered the first time Michell saw her have an accident. The two had just graduated, and to celebrate, three girls, Radha/ Michell/ Anisha decided to head out on a roadtrip. It was a long weekend, and about 300 miles out, Michell’s family owned a farm house nestled in the woods, offering a great view of the Western Ghats.

As Radha was the main driver, she refrained from drinking while the other two girls drank a few beers. The drive was smooth. They chatted away about their future plans, spoke about who each of them were screwing, and at one point, they just pulled the car aside, and squatted by the bushes to pee.

Radha secretly enjoyed the view of her friends peeing, and even noticed how Michell had a slightly damp pantie, at many occasions. There had been numerous instances when Radha came close to talking about her fetish to Michell. Somehow, she withheld this part of her life to herself.

Things were about to change. The trio reached the farm house, happy about the fact that the place was very private. There were two rooms, a large living area, a fully equipped kitchen, and spacious backyard, which opened up to a hilly horizon. Michell and Radha decided to share one room, while Anisha settled in the other.

Almost immediately, Radha changed into comfortable shorts, that barely covered her butt, removed her bra, and slipped on a long oversized shirt. “Phew, I’d die for a drink now” she said, and promptly poured herself a strong measure of rum, along with some coke.

Michell, right at the very beginning told her to take it easy, which Radha brushed it off saying they were on a vacation. Michell was in a celebratory mood herself, and without any further ado, she too poured herself a drink. In minutes, the three had spread out a large blanket over the grass, opened a few packets of chips, set up a Bluetooth speaker, and the drinking session was in full flow.

Michell had slipped on a comfortable cotton dress that she often wore to bed. Given that they were all alone, and there was enough privacy, she didn’t mind wearing this. Even if her panties showed, who cared, she thought. Anisha on the other hand opted comfortable clothing too, a gray sweatpant, and a white T-shirt.

From Weeknd to Red Hot Chilli Pepper, Eminem to Katy Perry, Radha’s playlist had the best of songs across genres. The sun was rapidly setting, and to mark the end of daylight, a fresh bottle of rum was opened.

Each of them frequented the toilet inside, and nothing was spoken about it. By now, Radha had successfully downed 4 glasses, and the looseness alcohol caused was starting to show. Her language now had more swear words, and sensitive subjects like how she had a night of her life with a guy recently was spoken in a more casual manner.

There was no judgment, the three were best friends after all. Giggles and laughs were the response, as the second bottle was polished off as well. Anisha was the first to call it a night. Announcing that she would be heading to bed, ashe walked back tipsy to her room. Leaving Michell and Radha alone in the backyard.

“I really need to pee” said Radha, half slurring and half giggling. She tried getting to her feet, and lost her balance. Michell was pretty drunk herself, and she just laughed as a response. Radha tried again, and seemed pretty wobbly. “Oh shit, I don’t think I can hold it much longer” she said, grabbing her crotch immediately. She knew how her bladder would behave after a session of heavy drinking. “I am just gonna do it here, fuck it” were the words that slipped out of her mouth, and with that, Radha took a few drunken steps away from the blanket, carelessly pulled her shorts down, and squatted facing her butt to Michell. “Atleast pull it all the way down will you!” Said Michell from behind. To which, “Too late!” Said Radha in the most casual tone, and sighed loudly. “Oh shit, you’re right. I am spraying my shorts! But holy fuck, this feels so good!” She laughed, as a heavy stream soaked her pantie and shorts, which were in the way.

MICHELL’S DISCOVERY

Out in the woods, with no light pollution, rays from the full moon casted a white illumination all around. Michell could clearly see Radha carelessly emptying her bladder a few feet apart. Watching each other pee or naked in general wasn’t an unusual sight. What was unusual was the fact that Michell found herself getting slightly aroused. Noticing the fine blades of grass, brushing against Radha’s fair butt, accompanied by the soft sound of sweet release, Michell could feel herself grow wet. This was unusual, she thought. Despite her inhibitied state, the logical side of her mind was very much active.

Radha, without a care in the world, stood back up. Her shorts and pantie slipped further down, resting on the ground around her feet. “I don’t think I can wear this now…” said Radha, murmuring drunkenly to herself. Not a single piece of clothing covered her lower body. She remained in that position, looking ahead blankly, as her mind figured out what needed to be done.

“Radha, I think it’s time you went to bed” said Michell, now walking up to her best friend. “Let’s deal with this tomorrow okay?” And with that, she gently placed her arm around Radha’s waist, giving her the needed support to walk back in.

“Michell, you are my best friend… I could die for you know… even take a bullet… you…. are…. my… beeeeessasttttt…. friend….” Slurred Radha, clearly drunk out of her mind.

This wasn’t new for Michell. She had nursed her drunken star on many occasions. However, pee was a new factor. Back in the bedroom, Michell helped Radha plant her naked butt on one of the wooden chairs, and pulled out a thick blanket. She laid it across the double bed, knowing Radha would inevitably pee during the course of the night. While her best friend rambled her love of Michell, the sensible one helped the drunken lay down, slipped on a fresh pair of shorts, and pulled a blanket over both of them, before calling it a night.

“Why the fuck am I so turned on! This is so sick!” Thought Michell, staring at the ceiling, while Radha slipped into a deep sleep. Making sure her friend was well asleep, Michell slipped a hand between her own legs. “Holy shit, I am soaked” she thinks, as the tips of her fingers trace the damp patch of arousal across her light blue pantie. Lips tightly shut, she rubbed herself, while she visualized Radha peeing in the open. In just seconds, her back arched, and a soft muffled moan was heard. Michell was breathing heavily, feeling the intense orgasm storm her body. Too tired to make sense of it, she closed her eyes, and called it a night.

“Michell, wake up! Wake up! Oh shit! I am so sorry about this! Fuck! Why do I have to ruin everything!” Jarred Michell awake. Warm rays of the morning sun penetrated the blinds, as sounds of various birds chirping were heard. “What happened!” Asked Michell, slowly opening her eyes to wakefulness. “I peed the bed like a fucking baby! That’s what happened!” Said Radha, on the verge of breaking down.

Suddenly, everything came rushing back to Michell. The night’s open wetting, fingering, arousal… all of it. But the girl didn’t show any signs of shame, fear or arousal. “Are you serious?” Said Michell, and pulled the blanket off their body.

Radha immediately frowned as the stench and sight of the her accident became evident. “Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I can’t believe this happened!” She went on a rant.

“Hey! It’s okay!! Listen it’s okay! Shit like this happens! Can’t really do anything over spilt milk. In your case, spilt pee!” Chuckled Michell, lighting up the moment.

(This is the first time I am attempting to write a series. It would be great to hear all of your thoughts, and inputs. Trying to keep the storyline as realistic as possible. And exploring the narrative style of jumping back and forth, from past to present)

*008*2023-09-06 07:26

Thank you! Means a lot :)

*009*2023-09-07 13:14

Finally, the release!

“I should call her, it’s been over a month since we caught up” thought Radha, after recollecting the initial incident involving a drunk bed wetting. Michell was the first person who was thrilled to hear the quitting part. They’d met at a coffee shop recently, and Michell couldn’t spend much time as she had to go out of town to handle some business.

Up ahead, about 100 meters away, appeared a tiny tea stall. Radha noticed that apart from a couple who were paying the vendor, there was no one else. Her feet lifted off the gas pedal, the sound of the car’s indicators came alive, as Radha carefully pulled the vehicle off the highway.

The couple gave Radha a casual glance, and got back to their conversation, while the tea vendor enquired what the woman needed. The aroma of fresh tea lingered in the air, as thick steam arised from the boiler pot.

Radha ordered an Assam Chai, and watched vehicles zip past her on the highway. “When did I become so fearful indulging in my fetish” she thought, as her bladder ached for a release, but a part of her resisted the idea strongly. Ever since she quit alcohol, her emotions felt more intense. Fear of being judged, seeking approval, and strangely, body image issues had begun to plague her.

From the few meetings that she had made, Radha had gained some knowledge about what happens when an alcoholic comes into recovery. Constant thoughts of picking up, justification that one is not an alcoholic, creating problems out of thin air, difficulty accepting certain things, Radha felt that there’s was list of fuck ups in her personality that needed to be addressed.

However, none of those really mattered at the moment, as her bladder was on the verge of explosion. Piping hot tea was handed to her, and Radha walked up to her car, leaned against the side door, and sipped her beverage.

Within the confines of Radha’s saree, especially between her legs, moisture began to form. Her damp pantie was rewarded with a steady stream of pee, quietly trickling down her smooth thighs. This felt incredible, consciously peeing herself without anyone noticing was Radha’s favorite indulgence. This time, there wasn’t a start/ stop approach. The flow was continuous, forming a puddle, while the woman continued to enjoy her tea.

Radha had mastered the craft of keeping things subtle for years now. Leaning against the side of her meant, her legs were positioned on a slightly elevated plane. This caused the trail of her pee to flow down the slope behind her, making a bigger puddle under the car. The nonchalance Radha demonstrated was so good that even if a person were to be standing close to her, they wouldn’t know.

A cascade of pee washed Radha’s inner thighs. Even without looking, she knew that the bottom of her saree would be slightly damp. After a good 30 seconds, the final part of her stream turned into drops, as she fully emptied her bladder on a highway. Her tea wasn’t done yet, so she stood in the same spot for a minute more, and then walked to the stall to hand over the empty glass. Radha was feeling extremely naughty as she paid the person, while her pantie stuck against her pussy.

To be continued…

*010*2024-04-16 12:26

A grin spread across Radha’s face when she noticed a puddle right beside the driver’s side of her car. She felt the complete wetness of her pantie as she lifted her leg to enter, and it was then that her innerwear pressed and stretched against her pussy, making her blush deeply.

Radha quickly entered her car, and pulled the door shut. Now inside, shielded from the outside world, the smell of strong pee hit her nostrils, making her want to touch herself right there. “That’s a bad idea” she said out loud, and immediately started her car, and drove away.

Google maps indicated that she was about 50 mins away from home. And driving that distance in soaked underwear was definitely not a pleasant experience. Something needed to be done, she thought. It was now that Radha spotted a 24 hour supermarket. To accommodate the cars flowing in, the parking area was pretty massive. Given that it was way past midnight, there weren’t many cars that were parked. Finding a spot, that seemed perfect, Radha pulled in and turned her car off.

She looked around, and observed her surroundings. The truck parked beside her had no one inside. To her other side, there were plants. Carefully, Radha pulled her seat back. With her eyes looking straight ahead, she lifted her bum and slowly pulled her saree all the way up to her waist.

Now bunched around her stomach, she looked between her legs. Her red pantie was soaked thoroughly. Using both her hands, she slipped her fingers into the elastic of her innerwear, and pulled it off her waist. The lingering effects of her AC still kept the cabin of her car cool. It felt incredible to expose her pussy to the coldness.

The need to touch herself felt a lot more stronger now. Reaching beyond her abilities to hold back. The coast around her was still clear. At a distance there were people walking in and out of the supermarket. There was no one they could see what Radha was upto. Out of nowhere, Radha felt a surge of confidence. There she was, at a parking bay, with her damp pantie around her knees, in the middle of the night, eager to touch herself.

It wasn’t long before her fingers found their way between her legs. Her pussy was now dripping with arousal, waiting to be stimulated. Without much hesitation, Radha used her middle finger to circle the area around her clit. Her neck instantly arched back, as she let out a deep moan. Her other hand gripped the hand break for support, as she went ahead and rubbed the most sensitive area of her body.

The inside of her car was now filled with moans. The sides of her inner thighs were now damp with her arousal. It didn’t take Radha too long to climax. Within minutes, she let out an animalistic moan, and sprayed out the left over pee as she came. It took her a few seconds to calm her breathing down. And when she did, her alertness returned. But luck was in her favor, still there was no one in sight.

Quickly she pulled her pantie all the way down, and tossed it in the back. She rubbed her bare butt to dry the pee on her seat, before sliding her saree back in place. Not wanting to arouse any suspicion, she quickly drove out, and entered back on the highway.

“I can’t believe I did that!” She thought to herself, while lighting a cigarette. The windows were now down, as the cool night breeze flowed in, making her smile.

To be continued…

*011*2024-04-18 10:40

It had been a week since Radha’s late night drive. Getting used to living a normal life without drinking felt like teaching an old dog new tricks. There were things that were said inside and outside of the meeting rooms that started to feel extremely monotonous and borderline annoying. “Keep coming back, it works”, “this too shall pass”, “one day at a time”.

“I am coming back everyday fucking day, but nothing seems to work. I am an absolute mess, my mood changes a traffic signal, my job feels exhausting, and for fuck sake, I am eating like there’s no tomorrow!” Said Radha, while she shared her frustration at a meeting. It was probably the exhaustion of dealing with change that led Radha to finally come out of her shell and talk about her emotions in a meeting.

“I am sorry, I don’t mean to sound all negative, but I just have to get this off my chest. Howeverâ€¦ the things I hear in these meetings also have a good impact on me. Now, I am slowly able to understand the disease part of my addiction. I am able to understand that there’s no way on earth that I can actually manage to drink in moderation. And deep down, I am happy that I have decided to come into sobrietyâ€¦” said Radha.

She felt her palms grow sweaty, but her heart felt light. Despite a whole room of people looking and listening to her, it didn’t feel uncomfortable. Their gaze came more from understanding. The nods felt assuring. For the first time in her life, Radha felt this sense of spirituality that couldn’t be put into words.

“So yeah, that’s been me. Before I conclude my sharing, I’d like to say one thing more. It’s been over a year since I cut contact with my best friend. More than a friend, she was a sister to me. Always worried about my drinking. I wanted to repair my relationship with her. And I am meeting her today. I am anxious, but I feel it’s going to work out pretty well. Fingers crossed. Thank you for listening” said Radha, and smiled weakly.

After Radha, there were a few more shares from other members. Each talking about their early recovery. Radha could relate almost 100 percent. It surprised her as to how comfortable they all were when it came to talking about their dark days, and the manner in which they drew their strength from those memories and experiences. Finally, the meeting ended with announcement, clean time call outs and the serenity prayer.

Radha had to meet Michell, the friend that she’d spoken about in her sharing. A few senior members shared their numbers with Radha, and asked her to call if things got difficult. It was strange how comfortable she felt with them. An hour ago they were strangers. And now, it felt like they understood her really well.

Seeing everyone off, Radha got into her car, and drove to the restaurant where her best friend and her would be having dinner. A constant sense of anxiety filled Radha’s chest. “You’re such a bitch Mitchel, how the fuck can’t you help me when I need you the most! All I am asking for is a loan! Which I’ll return to you in a few days”. Those were the exact words that Radha had screamed on top of her voice, standing under the balcony of Mitchel’s home a year ago. Neighbors to random strangers, everyone had witnessed this.

Drunk out of her mind, Radha had caused a huge scene. When she woke up the following morning, on the dirty floor of her own filthy apartment, empty liquor bottles and cigarette buds all over, her jeans soaking with pee, and filled with poop, Radha could no longer face herself. She couldn’t believe how low her life had fallen. Remorse engulfed her, as she saw her phone, and read the long message from Mitchel. Which basically said not to contact her ever.

Unable to come to terms with it, Radha sat there in her shit filled clothes, and continued drinking and crying. This memory was very vivid and fresh in her mind. Those were some of the darkest days of her life. It had been over a year since she had contacted Mitchel. Two days ago, she gathered up the courage and sent out a message to her best friend. Apologizing deeply for what happened, explaining to her that recently she had quit drinking, and was on the verge of rebuilding her life.

That horrific incident had a lasting impact on Mitchel. For years, she’d seen her friend progressively get worse when it came to drinking. After that night, Mitchel had to have a tough conversation with the owner of the flat that she had rented. Thankfully, the man was understanding and considerate. Over the next few weeks, Mitchel was feeling this deep sense of sadness. The initial anger had passed, and she missed her friend. They knew each other for years now. And just like that, Radha was out of her life.

There were many moments when Mitchel wanted to call Radha and check up on her. She was worried, and concerned. But something stopped her. The images of Radha calling her horrible names, screaming, and drunk flashed constantly in her mind. Mitchel was lowkey scared. Eventually, she made peace with the fact that Radha was no longer part of her life. Work at the architecture firm had gotten intense, Mitchel was handling multiple projects, climbing up the ladder, and living a decent progressive life.

On her personal front, she had come to terms with the fact that boys no longer interested her. And more importantly, she was slowly exploring a fetish that made her incredibly horny. Ever since she had seen Radha pee during the night they spent on a holiday, to her wetting the bed, something had switched in Mitchel’s mind. Truth be told, she’d even pleasure herself a few times recollecting the events that unfolded that night.

Mitchel was in the middle of a work call when she got a text from Radha. Immediately after the call ended, she read through the message her best friend had sent. Without wasting even a second, Mitchel had responded “Let’s meet on Saturday”, and that was it. Not wanting to talk on the phone, Mitchel looked forward for the dinner.

Sure thing, in the process of developing a new chapter.

*013*2024-04-20 07:06

There was this small quiet Chinese restaurant that Mitchel and Radha frequented back in the days. Nestled in a residential area, it hardly saw much of a crowd. Just a few regular customers, and sometimes a bunch of new people. Wanting to prove that she’d gotten better, Radha went that extra mile to dress up. Opting for a pair of light blue jeans, a white T-shirt, brown jacket, and heels, the woman definitely turned heads. The overeating had caused slight weight gain around her butt, but nothing too extreme. Pulling her car into the driveway of the hotel, Radha looked around to see if Mitchel had arrived. She knew the car her friend drove, and the moment Radha turned into the parking area, she spotted it.

The sight of Mitchel’s car would often bring a sense of excitement to Radha before, but this time, it did the opposite. Guilt engulfed her, as the heaviness in her chest worsened. For an alcoholic like Radha, facing a difficult situation was incredibly tough. While drinking, she’d avoid it, and now, in her sobriety, she wanted to run away from it.

“No, I am meeting her. And I am prepared for both the outcomes” said Radha to herself and parked her car beside Mitchel’s, and before her mind could convince her otherwise, she got out, locked the car and rushed in. Not giving even a second for her head to fuck around.

Wearing a pretty yellow dress, with print of white petals, and sandals was Mitchel. Seated in the right corner of the restaurant, sipping coke. She maintained a comfortable gaze, looking at the entrance door of the restaurant. There was no anger, frustration, or ill feelings that she was harboring. Infact, it was quite the contrast. She felt overjoyed with the idea of meeting her best friend. What made her even happy was the fact that Radha was no longer drinking.

The entrance door was of glass, and Radha spotted Mitchel right away. She entered the restaurant, and strong feels emerged within. She had no idea why, but her eyes began to moisten, her breathing got heavier, and before she knew it, she stood close to the table, and began to cry. It wasn’t like she was causing a scene, just an emotional moment.

Mitchel immediately pulled her into a hug, and stroked the back of Radha’s hair. “I am so sorry, I can’t ever forgive myself for using those words against you. I feel so horrible right now” said Radha. Mitchel didn’t say much, she just continued to embrace her friend, allowing Radha to express her emotions. About a minute had passed, and Radha quickly used a tissue to wipe the tears off her face.

“Listen, what’s done is done. There’s nothing that you or I can do about it. What’s important is that you realized where things went wrong, and took necessary steps to set things back in order. Let’s just accept how things went, and leave it at that, okay?” Said Mitchel, looking deeply into Radha’s eyes. The girl made sense, Radha looked back, and nodded.

“It’s kind of weird for two people to be just standing by the table and talking. Let’s sit down shall we” giggled Mitchel. A soft smile broke out on Radha’s face, as she looked around to see a waiter looking at them. Quickly, she sat down, and so did Mitchel.

For a few seconds they just looked at each other, and then, Mitchel said “I really missed you Radha”. To which, Radha gently held Mitchel’s hand and said softly “You have no idea how badly I missed your presence in my life. After that incident, everything went downhill for meâ€¦” before she could proceed, the waiter interrupted them, handing out menus.

The girls decided to order soups, and a spicy starter. Along with that, they asked for soda. The waiter took their order, and left the table. “I just couldn’t see you go down that path. I felt incredibly helpless. I realized that my words had no real impact on you” said Mitchel, talking about Radha’s drinking.

“I know, and there was nothing that you could do to stop me from drinking. It was a call I had to make for myself. After that incident, I ended up losing my job, my mother didn’t want to talk to me, she still doesn’t, and all I did was drink. I reached a point where I had no one around, and I feared my sanity. It was during that time, I came across a support group. Got some help from them, checked myself into a detox and finally got off drinking” explained Radha. Their starter and soup arrived, and conversation continued.

The next couple hours passed by quickly. Mitchel spoke about her job in detail. She explained how interesting things had gotten. Radha then told her friend about AA, her own job, and in general the two of them conversed. There was this ease and comfort that flowed between the two. It almost felt like they rekindled their bonds, and back to being thick friends again.

And just like that, the two were done with dinner. While they waited for the bill, Mitchel said “Radha, wanna come over to my place tonight? It’s been ages! And I really miss those nights when we’d cuddle and watch movies while eating ice creams!” Said Mitchel cheerfully.

Radha looked back at her nervously “You sure about this?” The last incident which had occurred still managed to bother Radha. It was the same house too. It was now that Mitchel held her hand again warmly “Look, we can’t let one incident ruin all the fun memories we had at my place. Can we please forget it and move on? It’s done. You’re in a better place now, and we are back to being friends!”

In silence, Radha looked back at her friend, and finally said “Okay, let’s put things behind us. And yes! I’d love to come over!” Hearing this, Mitchel got off her seat and hugged Radha tightly “Yay! This is going to be so much fun!” She said, excitedly.
