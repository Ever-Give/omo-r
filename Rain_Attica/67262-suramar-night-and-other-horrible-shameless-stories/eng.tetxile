Listen, I'm sorry about this, but I really just have to. This idea- no, this vision has been in my mind for a long time. I wanted to write it, so I did. You guys can't do anything about it, right?

This might be the most horrible story I've ever written. And by 'horrible' I don't mean terrifying or gruesome, but simply immoral. That's just how it is, I can't do anything about it, you can't do anything about it, so you may as well enjoy it.

The following story contains an obscene amount of ridiculous content. If anything in it offends you, that's okay, because it's your right. There will be lots of butt, and cock, and pissing, and vaginas. That's just how it is. I'm not sorry.

Lets be honest here. We all know why I wrote this. I wrote it because I was horny, okay? Mad horny. Unforgivably horny. So I wrote this. It's not for you, it's for me. There will be fucking in this story. There will be peeing and pooping. There will be uncouthness and hilarity. In fact, I consider this story to be so offensive that I'm going to put the entire thing in spoilers. Not to mention, if I get away with it, I will be writing more stories like this. Lots more. IMMENSELY more. I just can't help it, okay? It's in my nature.

Please forgive me for what I have written, for I know that God won't.

Suramar Nights

By Attica

(I'm not sorry)

This is a story about love.

Also, it doesn't take place in Suramar, not yet.

A huntress must hunt. It is who she is- it is in her nature. It didn't matter that the demons had been defeated long ago- she could not deny her primal urges. A huntress must hunt. That is who she is, that is what she must do. It is ingrained into her soul, into her very genetic code. A huntress must hunt. And so she did, every day, every night, she hunted. She prowled and searched, and in the end, often got what she wanted.

Tonight, she was hunting for pussy.

That's right, I said pussy. Can you blame her? It's so readily available! She thirsted for it like you thirst for a doughnut with your morning coffee. She thirsted for it like 5 more minutes in bed after your work alarm rings. She thirsted for it like a bottle of water in the desert, and that was simply her nature. No, she didn't have a 'succubus' as her inner demon. That's so lazy, isn't it? You see so many of these Demon Hunter whores that are like 'Oooohh that's just how I am, ooooh I gotta fuck, I have a succubus inside me, if I don't fuck I go crazy,' whatever.

She goes crazy if she doesn't fuck either, but she also goes crazy when she gets to the diner and they're out of hashbrowns. Repressing a demon? It's not hard. For your information, her internal demon was a Nathrezim. You'd think it would make her cleverer, but honestly, all it did was make her want to dominate everyone else. You just gotta play cards with it every once or awhile, or something, that's the trick to keeping it from getting bored.

"Living inside this demon hunter's mind? Yeah, it's easy stuff. Nice and relaxed, I don't mind! Really!" -A demon who is totally not being threatened constantly

"So yeah, I'm hunting for pussy," She said to her comrade as they sat outside on the front deck of some haughty bar where people ordered weird shit like coffee with cotton candy balls hanging over it so that the steam melted it into their drink and then it was all sugary and honestly didn't taste that good. The sun was shining in the desolate, dusty pit that was Orgrimmar City, and there was a demon hunter sitting with some of her friends at a cafe table in some corner of The Drag.

By the way, this story takes place in the setting of Azeroth. You know, Warcraft? Or 'World of Warcraft' as the young folk call it, that's what it is. Also, her name was 'Liera'. She was an elf, a 'blood elf' as they're called, because they worship the Sunwell and are traditionally empowered by blood magic and demons, or something. Look, I'm not an expert. The point being was that she was kind of short, had amazing curly black hair, and sharp red horns that are typically reserved for demons, but she wasn't a demon. "I'm sort of a demon," She explained, but nobody was listening. Nobody cared. Being a demon is overrated.

So she sipped her drink as she sat across from another huntress of her kind, some slut with long red hair and tough demony looking skin, and honestly Liera had fucked her a few times, but that was really the extent of their relationship, she wasn't looking to date. Dating other Illidari was a rough thing to do, especially because of all those skanky ones who are all about succubi- we talked about this earlier, weren't you paying attention?

The other demon hunter rolled her eyes. She's not important to this story, so I won't tell her name. Coming up with names is hard, you know, especially in a fantasy setting. I use google translate a lot. One of my friends uses the name of Greek gods and goddesses, and let me tell you, I'd totally be down to see Aphrodite piss herself. That's what this story is about, by the way, a girl who pisses herself. "Could you be more specific about what kind of pussy?" Her friend asked. Also, the girl isn't Aphrodite.

"Well, it was an elf."

"Mmhm, that really narrows it down."

"It wasn't just any elf. It was one of those new elves, the magic elves."

"Shal'dorei?"

"Sharty-what?"

"Shal'dorei. It means 'Children of the Nightwell'. You know, Nightborne?"

"Yeah, she had that sexy grape skin, that's for sure." The other Illidari that she was talking to bit her forked demonic tongue as she looked off into the distance at the edge of the dusty-ass valley that made for the capital city that Orcs lived in, seriously why does everything they're about have to be wolves or dirt or whatever? "Tell me about it, I love that skinny mana-addicted look they got, could cut a slice of cheese on those collarbones."

But that wasn't what Liera was looking for. "That's not what I'm looking for," Liera said. "She was different than the rest. She was sort of shorter, and she had huge tits, and a great fat ass. And, and she..." She leaned in and cupped her hand against the side of her cheek. "Well, she was drunk, and she clearly pissed herself." The other huntress gasped and clasped her hands against her face, looking utterly shocked. "Oh my God!" She said, again, utterly shocked. "That's what you're interested in!?"

There was an awkward pause, before the two of them started cackling. It was funny, because of COURSE Liera was interested in that. It was almost common knowledge among the Illidari. Most of them couldn't even judge her- plenty of them had worse fetishes, and lets be honest, girl pee is kind of hot, right? But this girl in particular was even hotter. "Now I know who you're talking about," Liera's unnamed friend said with a sage nod. "You're talking about the fuck-tempter."

The Fuck-Tempter. That was what she was known as. It was because she had a very particular habit. She was, despite her incredible fat ass, a very nimble and evasive woman. A 'Rogue', as they're called, not to be confused with rouges, which were women who wore too much blush. She was sneaky and clever, she was fast and nimble, she was agile, and hot, and had a stunningly fat ass, and a glorious pair of tits, and long straight white hair that went down to her butt, and a reputation as a real 'bad girl' in the best kind of way. And she knew it! She took advantage of it. To all who knew her, she proposed a challenge. "If you catch me, you can fuck me!"

Her name was Rain. And she had never been caught.

At least, not to the knowledge of anyone else.

Liera couldn't forget the day that she first saw her. It had been quite the day, to be honest. The days of the Illidari were either packed with violence, or hedonism. There wasn't much of an in-between. Sure, Azeroth had plenty of issues that needed to be dealt with, but at the same time, the MAIN problem they had been focused on for so long was done. The Burning Legion had been destroyed. Illi-daddy was busy fighting Sargeras in space. To be an Illidari nowadays meant either siding with the Horde (Or the Alliance, if you were one of those dirty Night Elves) Or just doing whatever the hell you wanted. That was their reward, their freedom- freedom to fuck fat booty elf bitches.

"So have you seen her?" Liera asked, and her friend rolled her eyes at her with disdain. "I haven't SEEN anything in decades," She clapped back. It was true, Illidari were, as a whole, blind. It was part of the rituals they underwent to gain their power. Tormented by visions of maddening cosmic truths and demonic tortures sown across planets far and wide, in the initial shock and madness of the encounter, the Illidari would, customarily, stab out their own eyes, or they would be removed by their master- while they would be blind to the world, they could see through the chaos energy that rippled through all worlds, giving them sight beyond sight, and strength beyond strength.

However, a lot of demon hunters grew their eyes back somehow. This was a lazy plot device used to explain why they could do things such as read a book, or see a boob, and get turned on. Liera was one of those demon hunters, because it just wouldn't be fair if she couldn't see the elves she went to pound town with. "Look, you know what I mean," She replied, rolling her eyes back at the other elf, as if flexing on her about it. "Look, maybe I've seen her, maybe I haven't. What's the big deal with this girl anyway?" Her friend asked. A wry smirk played across her face. "This one really hit you different, did she? Got a real thirst for her, huh?"

Many Illidari didn't wear shoes. They didn't have to, because of their partial demonic transformations making their skin tough and demonic. Liera's unnamed generic friend didn't wear shoes either, but it was because she had a foot fetish. She lifted her leg and slid her foot up against the inside of Liera's leg, between her thighs, and started to rub and play with her under the table. The curly black haired elf gritted her teeth a little, as she started to 'respond' to her friend's tender footsie play. She was one of THOSE girls... you know... the ones who aren't completely girls.

That wasn't really hard to do in this day and age, either. Plenty of horny ERP nerds just explained it away by saying stuff like 'it's magic' or 'She drank a potion and now she has a twelve inch donger'. Based on the sheer number of Draenei women who have nice fat horse cocks, it's amazing the species continues to survive at all. How do they get pregnant? Do they have a vagina under their balls? Can you imagine being born and the first thing that happens to you is a giant cock smacks you on the face? I can't imagine it. Actually, yes I can.

Anyway, Liera had a penis because of her demonic transformation. It was a demon peepee, and it was evil. It had a mind of its own. 'Bury me in her ass,' Liera could hear her dick whisper to her mind, and she reached under the table and smacked it. No. Bad penis! We're having a conversation here. "I remember her like it was yesterday," The black haired elf said with a wistful expression on her face, remembering while becoming steadily erect from the rubbing of her girl's big toe.

This was because it was yesterday. She had been at one of the more popular taverns in the dusty orc valley, looking to get a little drunk and try and take home some girls, or a particularly open-minded guy. Illidari were notoriously horny when they weren't full of rage, so it wasn't really too hard for her to get a girl, but she was getting tired of the skinny fel crack whores that she was bending over her kitchen table day in and day out. No, she needed someone with some FLESH to her, a body that would really fill up her hands- and then she saw her.

The girl with absolutely no taste, or shame, whatsoever. She had long, straight white hair all the way down to her butt. Her skin was a pleasant plum lavender color. She was short for her species, almost as short as Liera was. Her butt jiggled every step she took, even though she was wearing a dark blue skirt, with long white stockings that left about three inches of visible thigh, an embroidered tank-top that was a shade of magenta lighter than she herself was. It was the kind of shirt that didn't cling to her waist, because her tits were too huge and it pushed the shirt out. Liera could just barely see her bellybutton and her fleshy little belly.

She also could see that, if she looked closely, there was a visible discoloration on the inside of her white stockings. Not really noticeable for anyone who wasn't looking for it, but it was there. Those light yellow stains. She knew what kind of stains those were, and she instantly got an enormous erection. "Ow!" She bent at the waist, because she had been wearing her tight leathers that night, and it kind of hurt to have a boner this violent repressed by these tight pants.

She couldn't go up to her right away, no, Liera had to watch her for a bit. She was fascinating. Despite her incredible body and passably cute face, many people were annoyed by her, because her behavior was just outright unacceptable. She laughed and drank and went from group to group, telling jokes, insulting people, making a scene. Dancing on tables, lifting up her shirt and showing the bartender her tits to get a free drink (which worked), getting rough and handsy with others. Honestly, it was almost embarrassing to watch how she acted, but Liera couldn't stop. She was utterly fascinated.

She was about to go buy her a drink and try to take her home when the plump assed elven girl got into line for the outhouse. Liera stopped and waited, because no girl wants to be hit on while she's trying to go take a piss, that's just weird. But that was when it happened. The line was progressing along slowly, and she was bouncing on her heels, bending over and shamelessly holding herself between the legs, dancing a bit on the spot. It didn't take long for her to give up. She shrugged, stepped out of the line, stood with her legs apart, lightly pulled her skirt out, and pissed.

Liera's panties were getting stained with pre-cum, and this other elf's panties were getting soaked with piss. It was incredible. She wasn't embarrassed whatsoever. She didn't go and try to hide, she didn't take off her panties and squat somewhere. She just wet herself. Pee streams cascaded down between her legs and splattered on the dusty ground. They ran down the inside of her legs and soaked her stockings. She was pissing herself, right there in front of everyone, without even caring about it- she was even biting her lower lip a little. Liera jerked forward and bumped her knee on the underside of the table. People looked at her with some confusion, so she sucked on her drink to try and keep the eyes off her. They were looking at her? What were they doing looking at HER!? Couldn't they see this amethyst goddess pissing her panties and stockings, wetting herself, emptying her bladder, just peeing and peeing and-

She was done. Both of them were done, the demonic elf sputtering and shaking her thighs as she uncontrollably ejaculated in her pants. She hadn't even touched herself. Was she really this down bad for it? She'd been with curvy girls before, and she'd been with girls who peed before, but never quite like this. She wasn't even embarrassed- just smiling and laughing it away with her friends. She hadn't created a scene, the music hadn't stopped. Liera realized that this was because this was normal for her. That this girl wet herself just like that, often.

Just like that, she knew she was in love. The bad personality, the shameless attitude, the sparkling twinkling pee droplets that were still falling between her legs as she walked back to the bar counter- She was completely head over heels. ~I would fuck this bitch every day for the rest of my life,~ she thought to herself. Now, she just had to catch her. She downed the rest of her drink, and decided to approach her. So she got up, pushed her chair out, strode across the room to the bar counter... and ordered another drink. She had to avert her eyes a little, the intensity this thick elf radiated was like the sun. Sweat beaded her forehead.

~How the fel am I gonna do this??~ She thought as she returned to her spot with her next tall, frosty ale. This was unusual for her. It must have been because she was so awe-struck, but she just respected this girl too much to walk right up and ask her to come back to her place. She felt like a horny new acolyte with the hots for the most popular Illidari girl in Black Temple. She felt like it was an impossible, insurmountable task, to somehow seduce this stunner.

The 'party' was starting to spread out and head outside, because the sun was about to completely set, and the dusk time in the Valley of Orgrimmar was when the party goers started to come out. People of all shapes and races trying to get drunk, have fun, or have sex. The purple elf and her little band of extremely drunken cohorts, who had all tried to keep up with her pace and were failing, laughed and giggled with themselves and decided to go outside. This was because there was a band playing, and they wanted to dance.

So, Liera decided she'd try to dance too. Maybe she could somehow dance her way next to her and get a conversation going. As it was getting dark, other people were having the same idea. Flirting, trying to get laid... in a dark corner of the entryway a goblin girl was hardcore making out with one of those short furry fox people. ~I will never understand how people can screw the furry races, it just seems weird to me,~ She thought, a woman with a fetish for chicks pissing their panties.

The band playing wasn't too great, but it wasn't bad. It was fun, at least. And music was hard to come by. Sometimes people set up those portable music players the gnomes or goblins made, but they always sounded tinny, and they played the same crappy music, so a live concert was really something. Back when Liera was still human and she lived in Quel'thalas, there had been all kinds of stuffy concerts with strings and harps and horns and whatnot. Nobody had ever even heard of a 'guitar'. ~Guitars are cool,~ Liera thought, and I agreed with her mentally.

The purple elf was an excellent dancer. Liera fell in love again, watching her movements. She was lithe and flexible. She was smooth, and none of her steps had any wasted motion. It was clear that she was much more than just a pretty face and a fat, pissy bottom. The black haired Illidari, on the other hand, was channeling her inner Commander Shepard as she sort of bounced awkwardly back and forth, and made her way step by step closer to the girl with her provocative dancing. At one point, one of her tank-top straps slipped over her shoulder and one of her boobs fell out, and she just winked and continued dancing without putting it away. Liera's awkward dancing got even more awkward as she had to bend a little to try and hide an erection.

Finally, she was there. She was close enough to shoot her shot. "So... you do that often?" She asked, and internally punched herself in the face for not coming up with something better. The long white haired elf looked up over her shoulder at the Illidari. She smiled at her playfully. "...What?" She responded. It was too loud for her to hear. "I SAID DO YOU DO THAT OFTEN!?" Liera shouted so she could be heard, and the other elf sneered at her a little. "Do WHAT often? Do I know you? Who the hell are you anyway, weirdo?" She replied. Liera's heart sank.

"Just kidding," The other girl said, flashing a toothy grin and starting to dance a little closer to her. She didn't respond to her question. "I'm Rain," She said, moving closer and closer. Liera was nervous about it. "I-I'm Liera," She stammered. "Of- Of the Illidari."

"No shit," The other elf retorted, as she suddenly backed up and started grinding her bottom against the Illdiari's groin. Liera looked away and bit her lip, because at this point there was no way that Rain didn't know that she not only had a penis, but that it was erect, too. "Wow, nice cock. You wanna fuck?" She asked her. "Thanks. What? Um, yes," Liera responded, not realizing that it could have been so easy. Rain laughed at her again. She was clearly a bit drunk, but that was okay, because Liera was too.

She reached up and stroked her hand along the Illidari's cheek. "You're kind of cute. So, do I do *what* often?" She asked her, pressuring the other girl even more. She spun herself around and in a stunning display of flexibility, swung her leg all the way up, and put her heel on Liera's shoulder. She held onto her hip with one hand, and her shoulder with the other. At this point, you couldn't really even call this 'dancing'. She pushed her groin firmly against the other elf's groin, bouncing it and writhing her hips up and down. If Liera's tight leather pants and Rain's still pee-soaked pink panties weren't in the way, the way she was dancing on her, she would be plowing right into her pussylips like this.

She leaned in as she grinded herself, pleasured herself on the poor demonic woman's boner, reaching up and stroking her ear, and whispering into it. "Do I piss myself often? Is that what you're asking?" She whispered to her. "Did you think I didn't see you watching? Did you think I couldn't feel you watching me all night?" The Illidari's heart was pounding in her chest. Her hips knew what to do better than she did, and were gently thrusting back and forth during their 'dance' in the middle of public. Not too many other people were watching though, because there was PLENTY of dirty dancing going on tonight.

"That- that may be what I was asking, yes," She said with her gaze still averted. The intensity of this woman's gleaming white eyes, they looked into her very soul. They looked into her very boner. Her heart boner. She felt as if she might be blinded by them, which was ironic I guess. "Mmmm, it really felt good... I had to go so bad you know, I just couldn't hold it... so I did it... I let go... and pissed... my... panties. It was so hot and wet. It was so warm running down my legs. My stockings got so soaked. It went all in my shoes... And you just watched me, the whole time."

She pouted her lips out at her, putting her hand on Liera's cheek and making her turn to face her. "I just couldn't hold it," She taunted her, in a cutesy tone of voice. The Demon Huntress could only possibly get so erect, or at least she thought, but this freaky piss whore was bringing it one step closer to the edge, and she's about to break. "It hurt, so I went pee-pee. I went potty in my panties, wike a widdle girl. Did you like that? Did it turn you on? You sick little freak," She laughed at her, jabbing Liera in the boob harshly with two fingers. She swung her leg off her shoulder, and stepped away, and broke the elf's heart again. She was making fun of her the whole time? Just using her, teasing her, playing with her? Was that it? She had enough?

The big booty elf was walking away. "W-wait!" She was losing her. She stepped forward to try and chase after her, but she was so horny that it hurt to walk. She gritted her teeth and hobbled forward a little, but it wasn't fast enough. She would be long gone, before then. At least, she thought.

But then she felt a hand reach back, and grab onto hers. The Demonic elf looked up, to see her- she was back. Her amethyst goddess. She was holding her hand, and looking down at her, back over her shoulder. Rain winked at her, and with her free hand, lifted up her skirt just enough so that Liera could see under it, like she was peeking into a tent. She could see pee rivulets start to trickle from under the gusset of her still damp panties, see the pee run down into her stockings and get soaked into them. "Want to see me do it again?" She asked.

"Y-- y- yes. Yes I do."

"Then come on," She demanded as she started to drag her away. She was too excited to feel the pain of the tent in the crotch of her pants. Her wildest dream was coming true. Her heart was absolutely soaring, and just when she thought her cock had reached its limit, it became even harder. Plus ultra.

She dragged her back around behind the tavern, where it was dark, and nobody was there, luckily. Typically this area is reserved for people who are going to fuck in public, but right now everyone was still getting drunk or dirty dancing at the concert. Rain slammed her against the back of the wall and pushed her body onto hers. They planted their lips together and started to kiss, in a real dirty way. Tilting their heads against each other, mouths wide open, tongues writhing against each other, swapping saliva. The Huntress ran her hands up and down Rain's body. One hand slid down her side and around to her butt, flipping her skirt up and starting to grope and squeeze her bottom. The other went up her stomach and over her exposed breast, squeezing and groping it, running her thumb across her nipple, erect from arousal. "Mmmhhh," The purple girl moaned into her mouth, breaking their kiss for a second. "Yeah... that's good... I like a girl that doesn't neglect my tits."

She could have spent all night fondling her. They fit into her hand just perfectly- soft and fleshy, yet still supple enough to have some firmness. But Rain wouldn't let her- she pushed her back into the wall again, and started to slide down her body. She ran her lavender hands over her shoulders, over her breasts, down her side and hips... She unbuttoned the fly of her pants, and opened them enough to finally grant a reprieve to Liera's tortured cock. "Nice panties," She teased her. They were neon green, like the color of fel magic. "Wow. Slimy," She said as she pulled the panties off, allowing the other woman's cock to spring free. It was still covered in cum from when she had climaxed in her pants. "I knew it. You totally jizzed yourself when you saw me wet my skirt, didn't you?"

"Ah... yeah, I sort of did," She admitted as Rain popped the head of her throbbing cock into her mouth. Her lips were so plump and soft... she slid them further down and down, licking and writhing her tongue along it, sucking off all of her cum, pulling back off and smacking her lips a little. "It's a little salty. You don't eat much fruit, do you?" She asked her, and Liera blushed furiously and looked to the side, paranoid someone was coming. "I mean, most of us don't," She tried to explain. ~Why am I getting so nervous and acting like this is my first time? This is like, my two hundredth time!~ It's because you're in love, Liera, you silly little skank.

"It's alright. I like it a little nasty," The curvaceous pervert winked up at her, and got back to work. Up and down, up and down... she could really take it down her throat. Liera's legs trembled and her knees buckled a little, and she slid down the wall a few inches, head turned up to the sky in pleasure. "Auuauuhhh, ahhh, oh fuck me," She moaned. She started to hear a little pitter patter below her... under her feet. Looking down, she could see a yellow puddle spreading under Rain's bottom, splashes of pee running off her butt. There would be absolutely no denying that she wet herself now, there would be a big damp patch on the butt of her blue skirt. Liera's toes curled in the soil. ~She's sucking my cock, and pissing herself. She's wetting her skirt while she sucks me off. Oh my god, oh, my, god.~ It took all of her self restraint not to cum then and there.

~Man, I love to suck cock and piss myself,~ The horny Shal'dorei thought to herself. ~But there's one thing I like even more than that.~ Her lips slipped off the head of Liera's pulsating member with a wet little *pop!*, and she crawled her way back up the woman's shuddering body, chest heaving and her heart racing, balls absolutely aching to paint the inside of Rain's pussy. The purple elf leaned in and licked the nervous sweat off the Illidari's cheek, cupped her face in both hands, and kissed her. Typically Liera didn't enjoy the taste of her own cock on someone elses lips, but she'd make an exception for this incredible woman.

"There's something I have to tell you," She said, and Liera's heart twinged. Was she going to break it off, or something? "See, about fucking... there's this thing..." She stepped away from her, turning her back to the Illidari and folding her arms behind her back. "I don't go around just fucking anybody, you know. I have my pride. So, if you want to fuck me..."

"You have to catch me," She said, looking back over her shoulder with a devious smirk. Liera stared at her with some confusion, and stepped forward, reaching out and snatching the elf's wrist. "Caught you," She said happily, and Rain wagged her finger at her. "No, I'm afraid you didn't."

Before the black haired elf knew what had happened, she was on the ground. It was like the world had whirled around her. She was a little intoxicated, so that didn't help, but she should have been able to figure out what was going on. She was an Illidari! She'd given everything to fight the Burning Legion! She had extensive combat training and war experience! But still, this gorgeous woman had spun and thrown her, just like that, and now she was lifting her skirt, squatting down... and sitting her pissy wet panties right on Liera's face.

"You have to REALLY catch me," She explained as she grinded her hips back and forth, up and down. "Mmmhffh mrffrrf mrrrhhh," Liera replied. "That means that you have to win. I have to be helpless. I have to have no way of escape. You have to beat me... my pride as a scoundrel is on the line, after all." She sighed and rolled her head back, moaning as she pleasured herself on Liera's face, releasing what was left in her bladder and peeing on her.

She got up not much later, and in the time it took the Huntress to roll and get up, somehow the rogue elf had scaled the nearby cliff face, standing atop of it. A feat that not too many could do without a grappling hook or a flying mount of some kind. She was laughing down at Liera, her skirts pulled up under her arms so that she could show off her butt in those pissy pink panties. Two fingers were underneath each asscheek and she was bouncing her butt tauntingly at the demon hunter. "If you want to fuck me, you have to catch me! No matter what you do, you'll never fuck my ass, Illidari!" She cackled at her, dropped her skirts, and escaped.

Liera, down on the ground in the valley, grimaced and gritted her teeth, glaring hungrily up to the spot where the elf had been. "I will fuck her ass. I will fuck her if it's the last thing I ever do!" She resolved herself, and began the hunt.

The rest of the night was not nearly as eventful. She chased the elf around the city for hours, losing her and finding her again and again. Rain, on the other hand, had spent the night hopping from bar to bar, and partying and getting progressively more intoxicated until eventually Liera found her totally drunk and passed out leaning against a box in an alleyway, her skirts and stockings completely soaked, sitting in an enormous pee puddle.

The Huntress could have 'caught' her here, but she didn't, out of respect. Consent, people, it's important. She did, however, pick her up and carry her over to where the river ran through the city, and placed her on the bank, submerging her in the water from the waist down so that she wouldn't wake up with a huge rash. She would, however, wake up with extremely wrinkly toes.

"...And that's how it went, basically," She said, having told the entire story to her friend while she played footsie with her dong under the table. "Wow. You're a real freak, you know that?" The nameless elf said hypocritically, Liera gritting her teeth and trying not to show it on her face that she was gonna cum if this girl kept it up with her foot like that. "I guess it's pretty hot, though. Well, all I know is this- she's one of the nightborne, right? So if you're gonna find her... you gotta go to Suramar."

Liera nodded her head with understanding, looking off to the clouds in the sky. From her point of view, one of them looked like a girl's skirt being peed in. However, another cloud looked like a duck, and that was pretty cool. "I guess you're right," She agreed. She then got up and patiently left the cafe with her friend in tow, took her back to her apartment, and fucked her nasty up the butt for about an hour or two. With her friend satiated and passed the fuck out, she began to get her kit together... she was going to be travelling, to the glorious night city of Suramar.

Alright, I lied, there was no messing in this story, but there will be in the next one, possibly. Honestly I intended for there to be a messing scene, actually the whole IDEA stemmed from a messing scene, but I was getting tired of writing so I'm done. I'll do the next one eventually. If you like it, please let me know. If you didn't, then let someone else know, but not me.

Thanks Ray Ray. Chapter #2 (heh) coming sooner or later, right now I have an INTENSELY HORNY story in my mind that I'm going to put here.

The following content will contain sexual themes, pee, and poop. Viewer discretion is advised

Her

I make gears and interlocking bolts for a living. A long time ago, I used to be a witch, but those days are over. I wasn't a very good witch, to tell you the truth. I lived in the woods and all that, but I didn't wear animal entrails over my shoulders or curse people or anything. I didn't like to use the shadows, because they took my eyesight from me. Not that I'm blind- I just have to wear these embarrassing glasses. Every time I used it, my sight got worse. My powers, not the glasses. I used them a lot, in the past, to prove I wasn't a coward. But I was, really. I can accept that now, because of her.

As I said, I make gears and interlocking bolts for a living. I'm a tinkerer now. I always have been, even when I was a witch. It was hard getting metal and chemicals and minerals to work with, because nobody liked me. But I was able to mine and discover my own, and I had some... unique friends to help me. I love to work with machines. I never looked like a witch, because I was always covered in grease. I wore brown work pants and gray blouses. Being an elf, my face will never grow old and wrinkly and warty, but it's hard for me to look mean and cruel. I inherited my mother's face. She loved the world, and everyone in it. Unfortunately, I can't say I'm the same- I'm mostly just afraid.

~And unbelievably horny,~ I thought to myself as I sit at my work bench, carefully soldering wires together and attaching them to a motherboard I built myself. I had decided that I wanted to go back in time and make everything right again, so I'm trying to build something that can go back in time. It'll probably explode- most of the things I make explode- but if I can make it explode yesterday instead of today, I'll consider it a success.

Speaking of explosions, sometimes I explode into my pants.

It's not that I like it, at least, I didn't think I used to. I've just always had a weak bladder. I'm a dumb girl, and I get distracted easily. Get too into my work, ignoring my need to pee, and before I know it, I'm wetting my pants. As I said before, I'm also a coward. I get scared and wet my pants pretty easily, too. That's usually the worst of it, but not always. A long time ago, I was building a bomb. I like to build bombs, they're simple, and they're efficient. And they're good money. There are some people and some places I wish I could bomb out of existence forever, but I can't do that. That one day, I was making a big one. It was late in the day. I also like making bombs because it's exciting, and this one was the most exciting one ever. But, there was a hose I hadn't crimped properly. I was walking away from it to consult my blueprints, when the hose burst off with a loud popping noise.

I thought it was the bomb going off prematurely. If it had, I absolutely would have been dead. It wouldn't have been a quick, easy one, either. It would have been a firey inferno of a death. The burning pain and the radiation would be over quickly, but in that time, it would be the most horrible agony I had experienced in my life. I was completely, utterly terrified. I felt my heart racing in my chest so hard, I thought I was going to vomit it up. My whole body was trembling, my knees were quaking together. I felt this intense twisting, deep in my gut and loins. Sheer terror, racing down my spine- I began to wet myself.

It wasn't like I had experienced in the past, like when I hold it too long and uncontrollably start to pee. The twisting was an intense force. I wanted to pee. I could feel hot wetness spread across my lap, run down between my legs. Dozens of rivulets soaking down the back of my thighs. They dripped off my knees in streams, down between my legs, splattered on the floor. It all started coming out so fast. Before I knew it, my knees bent slightly, and I evacuated my bowels. The terror, the twisting, it was too much- it all happened so quickly. I could feel the resistance as it met my panties and pushed back against my bottom. My pants tented considerably, then mushed down and made a big, dirty mound on my butt. My pee stream tapered for a second, and then flooded back to full force as my bladder emptied itself. My pants were soaked down to the cuffs. I could feel my pee soaking my socks and getting in my shoes.

I stood like that for a minute, panting with exhaustion, my brow drenched in a cold sweat. I held my chest with one hand, trying to will my heart to calm down. I could smell what I had done- the familiar acrid scent of peed in pants, followed by the stench of what else I had done. I pulled my long, curly black hair out of my face with my other hand, looking down at the floor at the yellow puddle that had spread out under my feet.

Gently, I reached back and cupped the mound in my pants, curious about the size. I looked down at how soaked I was. "I- I j- I just... p-peed... and pooped my pants..." I stammered to myself, unbelieving. "I... I wet and soiled myself..."

Perhaps it was the sheer volume of adrenaline that had been released, or the relief I felt from having a totally empty bladder and bowel, but for a brief moment, I felt utterly exhilarated. My face was bright pink at the shame, and I blessed the gods that I lived by myself. I was, for reasons I didn't understand yet, completely fascinated with what I had done. I just kept saying it over, and over again. "I- I soiled my pants. My panties. I pooped my panties. I'm- it's all over my bottom. It's so filthy. I shit myself in terror."

Suddenly, I realized that I might actually die if I didn't turn around, and crimp that hose again. I had to forget about what I did. I was so panicked, I couldn't even stop there. I fixed the hose, and I carefully and painstakingly removed the primer so that it wouldn't accidentally go off, no matter what. It took about twenty minutes to do this, and the whole time I couldn't stop thinking about my pants wetly clinging to my thighs. The filthy mess in my pants I had to sit in in order to finish deconstructing the bomb.

When it was all done, I got up, shakily and slowly used a rag to clean up my puddle, and threw it in the work sink. I made my way to my shower room and disrobed carefully, and cleaned myself up, washed my clothes. Once I felt I had finally done a good enough job, my knees gave out and I sat down in my shower, hot water pouring over me, knees still quaking, breath caught in my throat. I cried a little bit. My hand went between my legs, and I started to masturbate. I pleasured myself furiously, thrusting two fingers deep inside myself, raking my fingertips along the top of my insides, abusing my clitoris with my thumb. I moaned and writhed, and shuddered with ecstasy. I didn't know why, but I just had to cum. I took one of my shampoo bottles and started to push it inside me, pumping it back and forth. The water from the shower washed away the froth I was building between my legs. But for some reason, it wasn't enough to satisfy me.

My panties- once white, now permanently stained a dirty yellowish brown color- I had washed them and hung them up to dry. I was compelled to stand up, grab them again, put them on. It took no effort for me to start pissing in them. I could feel it again- the way my pee stream pushed through my panties, the way the hot pee flooded all over my womanhood. I ground my fingers against my pussylips while I wet myself, and came to a tremendous, knee shaking orgasm.

After that, I started to wet my pants on purpose, sometimes. Not often- only whenever my thoughts drifted back to that day, that moment. It was rare for me, really- elves have an interesting libido, you see. It hits hard, and lasts long, but it doesn't come often.

But then I met her.

After my incident with the nuclear bomb- which I made a killing off of, coincidentally- I had redesigned the primer so that it could be inserted as the last step before setting it off. They were designed such that there was a slot for the primer, and a slot to store it in. The idea is that when you set the bomb, you insert the primer and lock it into place firmly. Then, you can either set the timer, or remotely detonate it. This was very successful for me. I had been told that my new double-safety design had reduced accidental bomb-related goblin deaths by nearly a third. As such, the war was going better.

The war. It was always so far away, for me. I lived by myself, all alone, deep in the woods on a peninsula that rarely saw action. Mostly, civilians lived here. A big cart from the war machine would come up once a month to purchase orders from me, and occasionally other elves came up to buy a gadget or have something fixed. Or to throw rocks at me, or tomatoes, or call me a wretch. I was used to it by then- I had believed it, actually. I thought I was pathetic.

One day, I got what I thought was another customer. I had been hard at work filling one of my orders, designing remote detonators, and it had been awhile since I had last gone. I figured that whoever was here was probably someone just looking to get a watch fixed, or something mundane. But when I went to answer the door, I didn't find anyone there. Confused, I looked out into the woods, turned my head left and right, but I saw no one. So, I turned around and went to close the door.

But as I did, I felt something cold and very sharp press against my neck. It was a knife- no, it was much bigger than a knife. A crescent glaive, made from moon-blessed steel and ornate, violet metal. My breath caught in my throat, and I froze solid, putting my hands up in surrender. My knees quaked again- that familiar feeling- I pushed my thighs together, and willed myself to try and be strong. "P-please d- don't kill me," I begged, not understanding what was going on.

I heard the voice of a woman behind me. It was strong, a voice full of passion and life. Deep and controlling, commanding, but she spoke to me in a language I didn't understand. It was close to my own, but it was just alien enough that I couldn't understand it. My knees just kept quaking. "W-what d-d-do... y-you want... from me?" I stammered, whimpering with fear. "You're pathetic," I heard the woman's voice behind me, speaking my language with disdain in her tone.

From my left, she produced something for me to see- I got a look at her hand. Much larger than mine. Strong, tough looking, pale lavender skin. Almost pinkish. She was holding something I recognized- one of my primers. "You are the one who made this?" The woman's voice commanded me. "Yes," I said immediately, wilting under her knife. I couldn't disobey her, for some reason. I knew the black words, and could have used them, but I was too afraid to. I could only submit.

"Disgusting," She spat back at me, and removed the knife. When she did, I felt a boot plant itself on the small of my back and kick me inside. I squealed in terror as I tripped forward over my own feet, falling hard onto my side. I kicked my feet to get back, holding myself up with one hand as I looked up at my would-be attacker, and was awed.

She was incredible. Gorgeous, smooth lavender skin. Eyes that burned bright white with the blessing of the moon goddess. A body that was built, lean and strong. Her shoulders were broad and reliable. Her legs were thick and toned. She easily stood a foot taller than me, and was considerably more fit. She wore elegant violet leather trappings, with white fur embroideries, white owl feathers, gold trimming and embellishments of the moon. The glaive she held in her hand was sickeningly razor sharp, and gleamed in the afternoon light. Her face was intense, and beautiful- her eyebrows sharp, her hair short for an elf, just around to her shoulders. A bright, mesmerizing maroon color, the same color of the sharp streak-like tattoos that ran across her eyes and down her cheeks.

She threw the primer into my hands, and I fumbled with it a few times, barely managing to catch it, looking down at it, and up at her. As terrified as I was of her, I was completely enraptured by her strength, her power. I was nothing compared to her. I was a worm, a piece of garbage. She was a goddess. "Do you have any idea how many of my people are dead, because of you?" She stated, commanding me to listen just with the tone in her voice. Sheepishly, I shook my head. "I- I'm j-just a- a craftswoman," I replied, but she hissed and planted her boot on my gut. "Silence! I didn't tell you to speak," She berated me.

"The stupid, degenerate little green bastards of your faction have been merciless with these bombs. Their destructive power is incredible. And, they don't even blow themselves up in the process. The forest can hardly protect us from these blazing fires. They burn so bright, it blots out the moon. Scores of my Sentinel Sisters have fallen, and it is YOUR fault."

"I-I d-don't have a... a... anything t-to do with that!" I whimpered, terrified. I could feel my cheeks dampen. I was crying, I was so afraid. I must have looked so miserable. This apparently pleased the other elf, because she smirked down at me like one would look at a bug they were about to crush. Her smirk turned quickly into a scowl as she knelt down and harshly backhanded me, for the mistake of speaking out of turn. "You will be silent until I tell you to speak, whore."

With an audible schwing as her sharp weapon cut the air while she lifted it, she pointed it again at my neck, encouraging me to obey. "You are to blame for the deaths of so many. As such, I am here to punish you."

I couldn't take it anymore. Just like with the bomb, I felt that twisting in my gut. My heart racing in my chest, my knees trembling. Tears ran down my cheeks, and I quietly, and pathetically whimpered, shrank back against the wall, sitting halfway on my side with my knees bent. I knew it was going to happen, but I couldn't stop it. This powerful, terrifying woman- I was so helpless, before her. I was so afraid. I started to piss my pants.

I felt the hot wetness spread quickly across my groin and all over my butt. It dripped onto the floor, and a puddle started to grow underneath me. The air was totally silent. Her ears twitched and perked up, and I could tell she could hear it. The pathetic, audible hssssssssshhhhhh of me wetting myself. Once again, I was struck with that fascination, but also terror. My long ears wilted and bent, my eyes screwed shut, and my pee stream picked up and I started to wet more forcefully. ~She made me wet myself,~ I thought to myself, over and over. ~I'm so pathetic and terrified, that I'm peeing my pants. Right in front of her. She- she's watching me wet my pants.~

She raised her fluffy maroon eyebrows as she watched, and her snarl of disgust twisted into an expression of amusement, perhaps even joy. "Oh, my goddess, are you pissing yourself? Hahahah! I can't believe it, are you truly this pathetic? Are all you elves like this?" I was too busy crying and whimpering, I hardly noticed her kneel down and grab my face, squeezing my cheeks. "Aww, did the widdle elf slut get scared? Did the dumb little bitch forget to go potty and the mean, nasty sentinel made her wet herself like a little girl?"

With my face held like this, all I could do was stare up into her intense eyes, tremble, and pee. "Y... Yes," I said, not sure why. I was just compelled to- as I felt the puddle spread out and go down my leg, I couldn't help it. "I- I- I'm s-s-sorry," I started to weep again. "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! P-please forgive me, I'm so sorry!"

She didn't say anything, at first- she just stared into my eyes, with those intimidating ones of her own. She smiled. She looked incredibly amused. I would never forget that look on her face- that look like she wanted to toy with me, like she was hungry for my suffering and humiliation. Suddenly, her look turned furious, and she reached up and painfully grabbed me by my thick, black tresses. "Shut your whore mouth!" She berated me, right in my face- I felt like she might rip my hair out. My lower lip trembled, my knees quaked, and I continued to wet my pants. "How many times must I teach you? You will speak ONLY when I command you to speak!"

As she told me this, she pulled me up, not to my feet- just enough so that she could grab my wrist with her other hand, and force me to flip upside-down. Her grip on my hair was firm, and she smacked my face down against the floor- not so hard as to hurt me, or break my glasses, but enough that it stung. "Look what you did! Hmmm, do you see what you did, you naughty, pitiful thing?" I could feel my still warm pee on my face. She began to rub my face back and forth across the floor- like she was punishing a pet for peeing on the carpet. I sputtered and gasped as my own pee got all over my face. My glasses went askew. Some of it got in my mouth. It was salty, and disgusting. "Bad girl! You are a very bad girl!"

After half a minute of this, it seemed I was allowed a reprieve. She released me, the last ounces of my urine dripping into my pants and panties. My thighs and body still quaked, but I felt so spent, so exhausted from the encounter. My nerves were fraying- I couldn't tell if I was terrified, or excited. "Oh, you absolutely need to be punished," I heard her say as she paced the floor behind me. I didn't dare to get up or even move my face to look at her. My fate was entirely in her hands.

She took me into those hands again- those strong, firm hands- grabbing me by the ear and wrist, and yanking me up to my feet. I cried out and whimpered in pain, wincing my eyes shut as she dragged me, deeper into the house- my feet felt clumsy underneath me, like I had forgotten how to use them. I thought, for a moment, she was taking me deeper into my cabin to execute me. A flood of relief washed over me as I saw that she had put her glaive down- but, I knew fully well that even without a weapon, this goddess could still kill me handily.

She was better than me in every conceivable way. It wasn't that my only option was to give up and submit to her- her very presence made me desire to.

When we got to my living room, the taller, stronger elf picked out a chair to sit in- a firm wooden one, and she dragged me along with her. My hair was wet with piss, and sweat slicked the back of my neck. My legs trembled and gave out easily as she yanked me down- and put me across her lap. My stomach rested on her thighs- I could feel how strong and thick they were, even in this position. This humiliating position- I had never been so embarrassed in my entire life. Little did I know, that this embarrassment would be mild compared to what I would eventually experience.

In one move, she yanked and shimmied my tan work pants and white panties halfway down my thighs. I winced my eyes shut- and her hand came down on my pale asscheeks, with a resonating clap. I screamed out in pain. It stung- it was only the first one, and it stung so ferociously. I forgot that I had experienced pain far worse than this. Her hand came down forcefully again, and again- she held my in place by grabbing onto my long ear. She was relentless, not letting me stop to catch breath, not backing off. I wanted to cry, so I did. I wailed like a pathetic wretch. I cried and I begged. "P-please! Ah! Ahh! I'm s-s-sorry! Aaaahh!! Ahhnnn!" I kicked my ankles, but nothing would save me from my punishment.

"Tell me what you are!" SMACK!

"I- I'm- mmm- I'm a b-bad girl..."

"Louder!" SMACK!

"Ahh! I'm a bad girl! I'm a very bad girl!"

"Tell me what you did!" SMACK!

"AAAHH! I-- I h- had an- an accident!"

"I don't THINK so! Be more clear! What did you do!?" SMACK!

"UUHHHNNN! Uhuhuhuuuu, uuhuuhuuh, I- I w- I wet m-my p-pants!"

"That's right. You wet your pants. You completely pissed yourself. You're a bad, pathetic, sad little elf who wets herself. Say it!" SMACK!

"AHH! I- I'm- I'm a pathetic little elf w-who wets herself!"

"That's right. Good. You understand." The spanking stopped then. But, she didn't let me go- she made me lay there, on her lap like that. Her hand started to rub my sore, abused, bright red bottom. Her hands had been so strong, felt so rough- I didn't realize that they could feel so tender. The pain still tingled, tears still ran down my cheeks. I cried so hard snot ran down my lip. My mascara was streaked all over my face. I looked disgusting- I looked like a mess. I was beyond humiliated, I was utterly, completely dominated. I had never been so sexually aroused in my entire life.

And she knew it. My labia had swollen, and between my lips, I was wet with more than just pee. "Ugh... are you seriously turned on? I can't believe it." Without considering my feelings on the matter, she plunged two of her fingers inside of me. She stirred them around, getting a feel for my wetness, for my womanhood. "You are! You're DRIPPING with cum. You are the most disgusting, pathetic, miserable little bitch I have ever had the displeasure of meeting."

Despite what she said, she continued. Her fingers felt amazing to me. It was like she knew exactly where to touch- exactly how to rub, exactly how to penetrate me. My lower lip trembled, my eyes screwed shut, and I stifled a moan of pleasure. "M-mmhhnn..." But, I needn't have bothered to try, because she let go of my ear, and stuffed her other fingers in my mouth- effectively gagging me. "You know, I did come here to kill you. But, you're just so adorably pathetic. Our goddess teaches us not to show mercy to our enemies, but I don't think you could ever have what it takes to be my enemy."

My eyes rolled back into my head. My whole body felt light, felt weak- the feeling of helpless compounded, but instead of terrifying me, this time, it felt good. It felt wonderful to be laying across this incredible woman's lap. Being touched by her. "I pity you. Therefore, I've decided. You can either die here and now, or, you can become my slave, until you make up for all your contributions toward the murder of my people. What do you think of that?" She popped her fingers out of my mouth to let me speak, and a strand of saliva came with them. "I'llbeyourslave!" I spat out instantly- unsure of whether it was because I cravenly feared for my life, or because I wanted to serve her.

"Eager, aren't we? Disgusting. Very well then. If you want to be my slave, you need to prove it." With that, she shoved me off of her lap, and down onto the floor. A miserable, quaking mess- so close to climax, but she denied it of me. She held her two fingers in front of her face, examined the slickness on them curiously- gave it a taste, and spat it back on the floor, choosing instead to reach over and wipe her fingers clean in my hair. "Grovel," She said, snapping and pointing down at the floor. I went to shimmy out of my wet pants, but she stuck her foot out and put it on my hand. "No. You wear your pissy pants until I say you can take them off. In fact, piss in them some more."

I could just about make out my own reflection on the metal of her shinguard- the way my lips pouted, the way my makeup had run all over my face. I looked so disgusted with myself. As she commanded, I hesitantly shimmied my clammy, wet pants back up over my butt. I got on both of my knees. I bent forward, all the way down, prostrating myself before her. My nose was touching the floor. I closed my eyes, and released the breath I didn't know I was holding. My bladder had refilled enough that, at her command, I wet my pants for about ten seconds. Again, with that audible hissssssss sound. The way it dripped off my butt and splattered wetly on the wooden floor, between my ankles.

"You will follow my every order with bated breath. If I say to kneel, you kneel. If I say you grovel, you grovel. If I say you pee, you piss yourself. No matter where we are. No matter who is around you. My orders are utterly, completely absolute. DO you understand!?" I felt a sharp thwack against my ear- a stinging sensation, and I yipped with pain. I looked up, and she was holding a thin little crop- she put it under my chin as I stared back up at her. "Y-yes," I said, nodding. "What are you called?" She asked me.

"M-my n-name is-" I started to murmur, and earned a harsh smack in the cheek with that riding crop. I cried out, tears welling in my eyes again, as it held my swiftly reddening cheek. "I do not care what your name is. You no longer have a name. You are called whatever I choose to call you. You are named whore, you are named bitch. You are named slut, you are named trash. You are named piss-pants. You are named toilet. And I, for the rest of time immemorial, I am called Mistress."

"Do you understand, pathetic-slave-who-wets-her-pants?"

The welled up tears in my eyes broke over and streaked down my cheek. I swallowed, my throat felt so dry. The words felt caught in there. "Yes," I rasped out, but that was a mistake- she whipped me on the cheek with her riding crop again, and I squealed. "Yes, Mistress!" I corrected myself, and she smiled again- that hungry, vicious smile, with her pearl white teeth. "Good."

With that, she bent over, reaching down and unlacing her boots. She popped them both off, and tossed them aside, sighing with pleasure as her feet were freed. She wriggled her toes, airing them out. Even in a puddle of my urine, I could smell the sweat on her feet. She had been wearing those boots for days. "Lick," She commanded me, and I stared stupidly at her foot. I didn't want to lick it. It was sweaty, it was gross... though I had already gotten my own pee in my mouth. "LICK!" She thundered at me, reaching down and grabbing me by the ear, roughly pulling me toward her. I cried out in shock, and stumbled forward, just barely catching myself on the floor, her sweaty foot right in my face- the smell was overwhelming. But regardless, I was so pitiful...

That I took her ankle in my hands, and started to lick her foot.

It tasted sour and salty, at first. But I kept licking. Mistress had commanded it. "That's right. Really clean it up there, piss-pants. Mmm... your tongue sure feels good... stick it between my toes." I did as she commanded, and gagged a little- the taste was much worse in that spot. "Suck," She commanded me, as she forcefully prodded her big toe against my lips. So... I did. I started to suck her toes. "Mmm, that's right... what an obedient little whore you are."

"What are you?" She asked me again. "Your slave," I replied meekly between lickings. "More," she commanded me. "I- I am your bitch." She reached between her legs, and undid her belt, pulling it free from her chaps. She put it around my neck, and tightened it, pulling it until it was like a leash and collar- and she pulled me more firmly against her foot. "More," She commanded me again. "I- I am your... your slave that... that wet herself," I stammered out. "More!" She commanded me, her voice suddenly becoming harsh, and I winced. "I- I am your filthy pathetic pitiful bitch whore, a- and I wet my pants! A-all the time!"

With her belt off, she undid a button, and into her pants her hand went. She was pleasuring herself. Getting off on my misery, getting off on how utterly submissive I had become. "That's right. That's all you will ever be. You're my property now. Now... mmnnh... and forever." She pushed my face back with her foot, moving to stand, and I thought it was over... but instead, I saw her drop her pants, and kick them away. Even her pussylips looked better than mine- even her hair was more neatly trimmed than mine, in a thin little strip.

"Lick," She commanded me once again, and tugged on the leash. She needn't have bothered- I wanted to. I got up on my knees and planted my lips against her womanhood. I writhed my tongue along it, I licked and lapped eagerly. "Ooohh... not bad... you're not entirely useless, after all," She smirked down at me. I looked her in the eyes, as she weaved her fingers into my hair, pushed my face against her groin. Tugged on my leash, choking me. My mouth was flooded with something hot and wet. Something salty. I sputtered and spit it all up, getting it all over my shirt, and she sneered down at me and yanked my hair in punishment.

"Drink it," she commanded me. At the time, I had thought it had been too far. I didn't realize anything, back then. "I- I don't w-want-" I stammered out, and her hand released my hair. Moments later, I felt the sharp sting of a blade sticking right into my neck. "Drink it," She commanded once again, and this time, I obeyed. I whimpered, I fussed, but I obeyed. I had just gotten use to the taste of her foot sweat, but now, I was drinking her pee. She ground her heel sharply between my legs, pleasuring me while I did it. Forcing myself to swallow it... feeling the hot stream spraying into my mouth, hitting the back of my tongue. I was terrified of the knife- so I drank. Swallow, after swallow...

My mind started to go hazy, then. I don't recall very well exactly how the rest of it went down, but I remember her leaning in the doorway of my home, her armor back on. Me, still in my wet pants. "You're coming with me. Gather what you need," I remember her saying. I nodded, and went to go change out of my pants, but she stopped, and grabbed my hand. "I don't think so. You're going to wear those for the rest of today. When we travel, you get no toilet breaks. You will wet your pants. Do you understand?"

Sheepishly I nodded, because I had figured so much would be true. I don't know why, standing there stupid with a blush on my face, but I wanted to hear her say it. "Yes Mistress," I replied obediently. I then started to pack. It took some time, and the sentinel was growing impatient with me. She started to follow me around, watching what I was doing, commenting on the thing I was packing. Telling me what not to take. I wanted to take some of the nice things from my kitchen, maybe present them as an offering to my goddess. So I reached for an expensive bottle in my cupboard.

"What is that?" Mistresses voice cut in, demeaning and judgmental. "I- it's- it's a b-bottle of Suntouched Vintage," I told her, showing her the label. She looked up at me, sneered, and slapped me across the face. "Are you fucking joking? Do you actually think you're EVER going to enjoy a fine glass of wine again?" Trembling, I took a little half step back. I liked my drink, you see- even for Mistress, giving it up entirely wouldn't be easy. "I- I-" I started to try and defend myself, but she smacked me across the face again. "You'll be lucky if I ever let you drink anything other than my urine. If I ever let you eat anything other than stale bread. Leave that here. You're never going to see it again."

"But I want it!" I interjected, which was a terrible, terrible mistake. I was severely punished for that. I had to leave half of the things I wanted to take behind, and that was after the vicious paddling that she gave me with the bottle itself, stepping on the back of my head, forcing my face against the floor. And then the journey that we took... that was entirely another story.

Today, I've been living with Mistress for about three months. Any of my previous passions were gone. She let me work on my engineering projects sometimes, like the time travel device that I mentioned earlier, but for the most part, Mistress was my entire life. I made gears and interlocking bolts, as well as other small mechanisms- and she made rifles with them. Not the shoddy, clunky blunderblusses like the dwarves made- elegant, pristine rifles. Highly accurate. Highly powerful, with my engineering in them. Beautiful, made of carved arcane heartwood she handled herself. I only worked with the grease and the smelt- the artistry of the craft, it was all hers.

In every way I could think of, she was superior to me.

And I love it.

I looked up at the clock I had designed myself, tick-tick-ticking away on the wall. The only source of sound in the room, other than the occasional hiss of the soldering iron connecting wires to plate. It was just about time to get to work, serving my Mistress. I put my project away, and pushed my seat back, standing. I crossed my thighs together, dipping my hips down, as I held myself between the legs. Again... I had been so engrossed in my project I forgot to go to the bathroom. Luckily, I was still dry. I could go and make it before work began, and with any luck, stay dry for the rest of the day.

I crossed the threshold of my door and started to go down the hall to relieve myself. The first hints of sunlight streamed through the curtains in our little home. I was about halfway down the hall, when I felt those strong fingers caress my arm. "Where do you think you're going, without saying good morning to me?" I heard Mistress say. I squirmed a little, hoping to get away, but in no time at all she was standing behind me, holding my wrist with one hand, pulling my soft, short frame against her tall, strong one. Pulling my back against her chest. "I- I'm j-just going to... get ready for work..."

"Is that so? Aren't you a busy little slave?" She whispered tantalizingly in my ear- she sucked on the tip of it, and I felt a shudder of pleasure run though my body. She let go of my wrist, to unbutton three of my blouse buttons- she reached her hand inside, to unhook the front hooks of the bra I wore. I bit my lip and whimpered, not wanting her to stop, but still desperately needing to urinate. "Y- Yes Mistress," I replied, as her hand went inside my shirt, and started to fondle my chest. Her hands seemed so rough, but her touch could be so gentle... my breath started to rise more heavily as she ran her fingertip over my stiffening nipple, repeatedly.

"You know better than that. You know you have to come grovel to me first thing in the morning," She chided me, but unlike when we first met, it almost sounded loving. Her other hand ran down my stomach. She started to grope me between the legs. Her groping fingers were firm, latching onto me... she pushed the heel of her palm against my bladder. Mistress knew exactly what she was doing. "I- I don't- I'm- I'm s-sorry-" I mewled, thighs squeezing together over and over, a shudder and a gasp coming from my each time she dug her palm into my bladder.

I couldn't hold it. My knees quaked together again, just like they always did. I stood on the tips of my toes, heels in the air, both toes pointed inward at each other. Desperate- so, incredibly desperate. "H... hnn..." A pitiful squeak of a whimper escaped me, and I lost control. I felt the hot wet patch flush all over my nether lips, peeing in my pants right against Mistresses fingers. The pressure caused my pee to leak back between my thighs. Wet crescents formed under my bottom, and rivulets started to run damply down the back of my legs. "Aww... already pissing your pants, this early in the morning? Did some stupid little elf forget to go potty this morning?" She condescended to me, still whimpering as I wet myself.

She pushed her fingers firmly between my legs, and then let go. Pee spread rapidly across my lap, and started to drench down the inside of my legs. Splashes and streams dripped down between my legs and soaked the back of my ankles. It felt so hot- the relief felt so good as Mistress continued to torture my bladder. My eyes turned back into my head. My toes curled as I felt pee soak into my socks. She continued to grope my chest, and she licked her way down my ear, and started to kiss my neck. "Uuuhhhnnn," a moan escaped me. "Oh my," Mistress whispered in my ear, reaching down and patting my butt, feeling the shimmering wetness drenching down my inner thigh. "Are you enjoying this? Hmm?"

"Y... Yes... yes Mistress..."

"You are? Really? Does it feel good?"

"It... it feels good..."

"And why does it feel good?"

"Because... I'm wetting... in your arms..."

"Do you love it? Say it."

"I- I l-love-- love it w-when Mistress... makes me wet myself..."

Mistress firmly groped me, swatted my bottom, touched me all over, as the pee soaked down my pants legs, dripped all over my legs and ankles. With a flick of her wrist, a sharp knife was suddenly in her hand, and she was holding it against my neck. This was nowhere near the first time this had happened, and I knew what it meant. The terror of having a knife to my throat... I whimpered, my knees bent more. I felt it again, just like that time so long ago- the twisting, in my lower stomach. I shuddered, gasped out for air. I was terrified, I kept trying to convince myself. So terrified... my heart racing again, just like it did that day.

The uncomfortable, unusual feeling of my panties tenting. The way I dug my fingers into my palms. The tent grew larger and larger, and my blush of shame grew hotter and hotter. Finally I passed the point of no return, and it all came rushing out. Completely filling the seat of my pants. Helpless, terrified, I did it again- I soiled myself. Right in my Mistresses lap- I wet my pants, and shit my panties.

I had been living with Mistress for seventy three days, by that point. Occasionally, I was able to be a good girl and allowed to use the potty, to stay dry. However, out of those seventy three days of living here, seventy three times, I had pooped my pants. A few times, I didn't even do it because Mistress commanded me to. My mind raced, the way it always did. ~I wet my pants and shit myself, ohh, ohhh I did it, I'm a bad girl, I used my pants as my toilet, I COMPLETELY flooded and crapped myself, oh no, oh no, I'm a bad girl, I'm a VERY bad girl!~

That was when I heard the snap of the lock. A simple little padlock, not too difficult to remove. But I couldn't remove it, because Mistress put it on me. She locked my belt. She had locked my pants into place- my eyes went wide as I realized what that meant. "That's right... now it's time to get to work. Go on- have a seat at your desk," Mistress said, guiding me into the room, tears forming in my eyes. "Ugh, you stink. You're so absolutely, completely, disgusting. You filthy, naughty girl."

True to her word, I spent hours sitting at my work bench, stewing in my own horrible mess. Being forced to live with the stench of it. Not even a mercifully opened window helped to mitigate it. The filth all over my bottom, spreading every time I had to adjust myself in my seat... I wanted to cry, I wanted to throw up. But this was my reality now- if this was what Mistress demanded of me, this is what I would get.

And I was rewarded, in the end. After a few hours, she un-shackled me from the bench, and took me to get cleaned up. A process made even more humiliating, because she made a point of cleaning me. As if I were unable to do it myself- as if I was too stupid, or meek, or miserable. But even if it was humiliating, it was an incredible process to me- despite her apparent strength and viciousness, Mistress had such tender hands. Her touch was fastidious, detailed, caressing and concerned. She took me to her bedroom afterwards, and we made love, for nearly an hour. As I laid on the bed in a trance, enraptured by the pleasure, my head rolling from side to side on her pillow, she set about to the business of putting me in diapers, like she had done many times before.

Freshly powdered and padded up, I lolled my head to the side, and stared out the window. Mistress pulled the blinds shut, and she threw a large, soft blanket over me. It was nap time, it seemed- not that I would be able to do anything about it, spent as I was. I had resigned myself to some alone time in the dark, when I felt the covers shifting. She slipped into bed behind me, pulling me tenderly into her waiting arms. Letting my head rest on her bicep. Caressing my hair, whispering things to me I was too exhausted to understand. I felt more comfortable than ever, safer than ever, in her protective embrace.

I fell asleep, and I dreamt of only one thing.

Her.

I'm really enjoying these two characters, and will probably write about them a lot. I plan to circle back to Liera and Rain at some point, but I'm feeling more about this hardcore domination scene. Now that I've established both of their introductions, I can start writing shorter snippets about their lives together, and speaking of that, I am somehow still horny enough to want to write more after dropping all that, so here we go. As always, if you enjoy any of my stories, please let me know! I'm happy to take criticism as well.

Her

(Part 1.1)

I woke up wetting myself.

Despite what you now know about me, this was not actually the norm. True, I used to wet the bed whenever I would get too intoxicated, but since I came to live as Mistress's slave, I haven't had a drop of alcohol. Thankfully her threat to feed me old bread and water me with her pee was only that, a threat, and I had been living on local fare and the recipes of her people. They always had this refreshing earthiness to them. I miss the sharp flavors and savoriness of my own people's dishes, but I wasn't complaining. My life felt like a dream. I was utterly, unequivocally in love. I love Mistress, more than anything.

But back to the point- I woke up, and I was wetting myself.

I lifted my head with a little gasp, unfurling the bedsheets and looking down at the puddle I was no doubt creating. Except, I wasn't. I had forgotten- at the end of the last day's play, Mistress put me in diapers again. They were getting warm and wet, starting to swell as they soaked up my pee. They were classic, bright white diapers intended to be puffy, obvious, and embarrassing to wear, and they easily turned yellow. I blushed as I watched them change from white to pee discolored. Then, I rested my head against my pillow, and sighed with relief.

I like diapers. They have all the aspects of humiliation that Mistress loves to put me through, but with none of the clean up. They made me feel safe and protected. They were soft, and when I wear them, I feel shy and girlish. It's okay for a diaper-wearing coward like me to wet herself. That's what diapers are for. So I let my legs fall effortlessly open, I turn my head to the side and close my eyes. I put my finger in my mouth, nibbling on the tip of it, while I simply... let go.

But still, it was unusual.

I felt fingers gently reach down, and push on the front of my diapers. Fingers rapping against the padding, pushing them against my groin so that I could feel the hot wetness flooding all over my womanhood. My eyes fluttered open as I turned my head, to look up at her. Her- always, her. In my every waking thought, in my dreams. There when I went to sleep, there when I awoke in the morning. She was sitting on the edge of the bed, with her legs crossed, looking down at me with those hungry, amused eyes. She was fully dressed up.

And by dressed up, I meant, in her dominatrix clothes. Sleek, magenta red leather that almost matched the color of her hair. Leather chaps that bound her muscular legs tightly, with the groin cut out so that her genitals were exposed. A tight corset that squeezed her strong frame and boosted up her breasts. Large holes cut in the chest, so her breasts were exposed entirely. Long red silk gloves, that went well past her elbow. A mask, a sharp looking thing with flaring horns that covered only her eyes and the bridge of her nose. My heart started to beat faster, just at the sight of her. She had her riding crop sitting across her lap- she took it and started to run it along my collarbone, dragging it down between my own exposed breasts. I had spent the night wearing nothing but a diaper.

"Aww. Naughty little piss pants, first thing in the morning and you're already having an accident? What am I ever going to do with an incontinent little slut like you?" She asked me, thwapping the groin of my diapers a few times with her crop. It didn't hurt at all, with the padding protecting me. I flushed with shyness and squirmed in bed, my lips pouting. "I- I'm sorry Mistress... I wet myself again..."

That pleased, amused smile returned to her lips, and I felt my own heart race with happiness and excitement. I loved seeing that look on her face. But, to tell you the truth, I also had become fixated on words and phrases. It felt as good, perhaps even better, to tell my Mistress that I had an accident, than actually peeing. Even saying it in these memoirs, it excites me still. I am a dirty, pitiful little elf, and I wet my pants every single day. Mistress's love helps me to embrace it.

"Of course you did. That's why I make you wear diapers," Mistress tells me, as she starts to run the riding crop along my body again. Starts to tease it in circles around my areola. Prods my nipples with it, pats my cheek with it. "B-But it's... it's unusual," I reply. "I... I don't n-normally bedwet..."

"You're just starting to become completely incontinent. You're so wretched, you just can't help it. That's why I take care of you, my little piss pants," Mistress coos to me, bending down and holding my cheeks in her hands, kissing me sweetly on the forehead. I want to believe her, but I recall her now making me take something with my water before I went to bed. Perhaps some kind of medicine, to make it harder to retain control. Still, I don't mention it. "Yes Mistress," I murmur submissively. "I'm just a pantswetting elf."

As I speak, she lifts my arms, up above my head. Mistress has a pair of handcuffs- she pulls my wrists behind my back, and puts them on me. She forces me to spread my legs. From her bedside drawer, she takes one of her favorite toys- her remote controlled little egg. I made it for her myself. Of course, it was more like a present for me, since I'm the one she uses it on. She pulls the front of the waistband out, making a show of peeking inside and clucking her tongue at me. "Look at you, completely soaked. You are so utterly hopeless, aren't you?" She pushes on my bladder, and to my surprise, I pee. Normally when she does that, it makes me HAVE to pee, but doesn't cause me to actually do it. I watch with fascination as I arc a short stream for a few seconds into my diapers. Pussylips freshly wet, she slips her hand down and inserts the egg toy into me, right up against my clitoris, and starts it on a low setting.

"A-aa--ahhh...." A breathy, chattering moan escapes my lips. I writhe against the handcuffs. "You... are such a bad, bad girl," Mistress tells me. She retrieves one of her special candles from the bedside table- she increases the intensity of my vibrator, as she drips the wax over my chest. It burns hot on my sensitive skin, but it cools in an instant- compounded with the shame and the pleasure, it feels incredible to me. "I- I'm a bad girl that wet her diapers," I reply shyly. This elicits another one of those wonderful hungry smiles. "That's right. You are. And that's not all you do."

She increases the intensity another level. "Unnhhmmm... unn, I... I wet.... my pants, too... my skirts... my panties... I'm always making puddles... a-always peeing my pants... and..."

"And?" She urged me to continue, increasing the intensity just a little more, reaching down with her free hand and putting a clothespin on my nipple. "Ah! Ahh, I, I, I p-poop my pants! I'm a bad dirty elf who wets her pants and poops her panties!"

She brings the intensity up even higher, leaning over me and clothespinning my other nipple. She bends down and sticks her tongue in my mouth, lewdly taking a kiss from me, and biting my lower lip. "Soil yourself, this instant," She commands me. I bend my knees, clench my fists, and start to go-

When suddenly, there's a knocking at the door. Mistress whirls her head up and looks towards the front hall from our bedroom, and sneers with irritation. "Who the fuck is that? I don't have any customers today," She said. She put a finger against my lips before I could speak. "Save that thought. Don't you DARE soil yourself without me. And stay here." For some reason, there's not just a tone of irritation in her voice, but also, some worry. She pulls off her mask, sitting it on the bedside table, and she yanks her bathrobe out of her cabinet, a silky mooncloth thing, dyed a pale pink with berries. She storms out the room, to the front door.

I hear her throw it open, and I hear her harsh voice. "I'm not open- Oh! It's you," I hear her say. You? Did she have a visitor she recognized? I was content to writhe on the bed and moan quietly- she had left the vibrator on, after all- but I was curious too, so I got up, and just barely peeked my head out the doorframe, to see who it was.

"It's me!" I hear a cheery voice in the doorway. It was nearly grating- entirely too cheery. Like butterflies having a tea party. "I brought the new shipment of ores, as you requested. Gotta say, this is unusual, I didn't know you had any expertise working with these materials, Ka- Mmmff!" I saw my Mistress reach through the door, and swiftly cover their mouth. "No names!" She hissed at her. She beckoned for her to come inside.

"No names? Ooooh! Does that mean you have... a new one??" The too-cheery female voice chimed like a bell. I saw a tower of bright powder blue enter the building. I recognized immediately that this was going to be a very awkward situation. She was one of those ex-demon people, the ones with horns and a tail and hooves... and incredibly long, thick legs... and perky, large breasts that strained her tight green top that was supported by only a collar instead of sleeves. Not to mention, she was exactly as tall as Mistress. Mistress was exceptionally tall, even for her people- she utterly towered over me, so, seeing someone else as tall as her came as a shock. She had bouncy, curly blonde hair, styled into dozens of drills that gave her the look of a fancy gilded curtain or something.

This was bad news, as I explained before. See, that would be because a long time ago, during the Third War- or perhaps was it after the Third War? Either way, my people did some absolutely horrible things to her people. Essentially they were a nomadic people and they sabotaged their craft and lots of them died, both in the conflict and the ensuing crash after. Back then I was engrossed entirely in my studies of the Black Words, so I didn't actually take part in any of this, but that didn't matter. To her, I would be an enemy. I whimpered and backed away through the doorframe, a whisp of my black hair showing as I looked frantically for somewhere to hide.

"As a matter of fact, I do have a new one," Mistress explained, "And we were in the middle of an important... bonding session, so lets just get this over with." Apparently the bubbly bluebell had no intention of quietly going along with it. "Oh, nonsense, Mistress!" She said in a tone of voice that implied she didn't take my Mistress seriously, which was a great way to make her very angry. "I just have to see it! You let me see all the others, why not this one?" She asked, and I could feel Mistress glaring at her even though we were separated by the wall. And, now, by the mattress, because I was hiding underneath it. Whimpering and pushing my hands into my groin, writhing from the vibrations. I could have just taken it out, but that would have been disobedient, and I was a very obedient slave.

"This one is special," Mistress replied coolly, despite the way she was being spoken to. I was impressed with her levelheadedness. I had only ever known her to be harsh and fiery, or tender and loving- it was interesting to hear her being icy, and calm. I blushed with a feeling of pride. Mistress said I was special! But, perhaps she meant special in a... different way. "I don't care, let me see it anyway. Whatever freaky thing you do to her, I don't mind."

There was a long pause, and I heard an audible sigh of irritation. "Very well," I heard Mistress say, and I whimpered and balled myself up tighter under the mattress. I didn't want to see her! Even if she wasn't a species that hated mine, I didn't want anyone seeing me in wet diapers! Not that I hadn't been seen like this before in public, but, that was a story for a different time. I heard Mistress's heels and the other woman's hooves clicking along the floor, and heard the doorway creak as it was pushed open. Mistress clicked her tongue with annoyance. "I thought I fucking TOLD you to stay HERE!" She yelled at me, and I flinched. "Aww, is it too shy to come out?" Mistress's associate asked. There was a brief pause, and then- "Ah. It's under the bed."

My eyes went wide in shock. How did she know? She hadn't even attempted to look for me! But she was right. Mistress heeded her advice and bent down, poking her head under the bed and glaring at me. "What are you doing here, slut? We have a guest. Get out." She grabbed me by the ear and pulled, and I cried out and kicked and resisted her. "N-no! I- I d-don't want to come out!" This only caused Mistress to pull my ear harder. "What the hell did you just say to me? Did you already forget that when I give you an order, you FOLLOW it!? This is twice you've disobeyed me now. I'm going to have to punish you very severely."

And so, against my will, I was dragged out from under the bed. Just enough so that my head and half of my upper body popped out enough to be seen. My ears were wilted in shame, my face red with humiliation, lips turned into a spoiled pout. I did not want to see this woman, and for good reason. Immediately the one with horns sneered down at me and pointed accusingly. "Um. What the hell is that?" She asked.

"This is my new plaything. You are being VERY disobedient. Get out from under there!" Mistress grabbed my hair and tugged, but I fought regardless. "Are you fucking kidding me with this? THIS is your new plaything? You aren't being serious, are you? You know what that is, right? Is this like when a cat plays with its food before killing it?" The horned woman spat harshly. True to my concern, she hated me, because of what I was. A player on the other team, so to speak... and Mistress was growing incredibly irate.

"What I do with my property is MY business," She said, letting me go and turning to stare down her 'friend'. She walked right over to her, glaring at her face from only a few inches away. "I have her under control." The bluebell 'tsk'd her tongue back, turning her face away and glaring back out of the corners of her eyes. "Have you forgotten how dangerous these things can be? What they do? They scheme, they plot, they betray. You might think you have her under control, but she might just be using you." Mistress barked a harsh laugh in return. "Her? She's far too pathetic for anything like that. She's nothing more than my property. She can't do anything."

"I- I didn't- I didn't d-do anything," I stammered out, still frowning at the other woman. Down on the floor like this, she stood so tall over me. I was almost as intimidated as I was by Mistress. I could sense strength in her too. She wasn't as fit and toned as Mistress, but I could tell she had other powers. And it seemed, she could tell, so did I. "You didn't do anything? The wind whispers to me otherwise. You've done plenty of things. Ka-- ahem, 'Mistress' could not possibly punish you enough to pay for the weight of your sins."

Mistress slapped her firmly across the face. "I will be the judge of that. How dare you come into my bedroom and treat my property in such a way." The air was still, as the blue woman looked back at my pink Mistress, holding her face where she was slapped. She had seem stuck to her virtues, but what was that look in her eyes? Was it... fear? She looked back down at me, and bit the corner of her lip. I could feel the two of them judging me with their gaze. These two tall, strong looking women... with conviction, and backbone... I shrank down under their gaze. I realized I did not deserve to be fought over like this. I was just a short, weak toilet slut, my only redeeming qualities being my skill with machinery, knowledge of how to use my tongue, and my bottom, which was the largest out of all the women currently in the room.

"Well... she is pretty cute. And she does look oh so miserable. Perhaps I can entrust her punishment to you!" The hooved woman decided as she looked me over. She shot a glance back up at Mistress, and gave her a cryptic warning: "But you had best be certain to teach her to watch her tongue." The warning apparently went over Mistress's head, but, it stuck with me. What did she mean? Was she talking about the Black Words? Could the wind tell her that?

I would never use the Black Words on Mistress. I will never use them ever again, because I don't need to. Mistress protects me now. I'm safe, with her. I'm not afraid of anything anymore, other than... her.

As I ruminated on the thought, I squealed with dismay as Mistress suddenly grabbed my wrist, and pulled me out from under the bed, forcing me up to my feet- holding my arm above my head, only the tip of one toe could reach the floor- she held me effortlessly with her strength, and even if I wanted to kick and get away, I couldn't. My face turned completely red, and I tried to cover up my diaper with my free hand. The horned girl gagged a little at me. "Oh, my fuck, are you serious right now? Is that a diaper? Hahahaha! That's disgusting! Is that what she likes, huh? Ugh! Look, it's yellow! She wet herself!" The blue woman continued to point and laugh at me, and I wanted to curl up and die. I removed my hand from trying to cover my diapers, and instead used it to cover my face instead.

"That's right," Mistress confirmed. "She wets her diapers." How could she just outright say that to someone I didn't even know?! Wasn't she embarrassed herself? My lip quivered and tears started to well up in the corner of my eyes, and trickle over onto my cheeks. "Aww, look, we made her cry!" The blue woman jeered, stepping over and tugging harshly on my hair. I yipped in pain, and Mistress grabbed her wrist, and forced her to withdraw her hand. "No touching," She sternly warned her, and her friend scoffed and took a step back. "I can't believe it. An elf like her, and look what she's wearing. You must hate your life right now. Ugh, she's so gross. Don't tell me that's all she does."

"It isn't," Mistress smirked, looking me over with those condescending, mocking eyes. "Tell her what else you do, bitch." My fel green eyes darted from woman to woman, turning my head to Mistress, unsettled. "Y- you-- you mean-?" I cried out as she harshly slapped me across the face. Apparently I was embarrassing her in front of her friend. "You know EXACTLY what I mean. Say it, whore."

Mistress mercifully dropped me then, so I could squirm on the spot, twiddling my fingers together in front of my chest, forearms close together to cover up my exposed tits. This was a rush in its own right. I was angry... I think. But I was so submissive to Mistress, I couldn't act on that anger. "I- um... I..." The horned girl turned her head and cupped a hand to her ear. "What? Speak up! Quit stammering like you don't even know how to speak, you stupid diaper bitch."

My face was bright red with humiliation and frustration. I screwed my eyes shut, and dug my nails into my palms. "I piss my pants!" I admitted. The rush I got from it was incredible. A complete stranger, coming in and seeing me in wet diapers, and now I'm telling her that I wet my pants, too. I wanted more. "And- and I- I p-p-- poop my pants... too..."

My legs gave out, and I slid down to the floor. I covered my face with both my hands, beyond embarrassed. I heaved and whimpered, seeming like I was crying, but really I was stifling the moans of pleasure. The egg vibrator was still well at work in my folds, and I was positively dripping. The other two women were so quiet. I could tell, Mistress's friend was staring at me, in complete and utter disgust. It was silent, save for my whining, for a full half a minute, until finally the blue girl spoke up-

"...I want to see."

I uncovered my face and looked up at her, and then up at Mistress. My elven goddess had that toothy, hungry look on her face again, and I knew my suffering was about to increase greatly. "Certainly," Mistress agreed as she forced me to get back up on my knees. She tore off the tapes on my diaper, disposed of it. She dug her finger around inside me, until she found and popped out her remote controlled toy- turned off, and put on the sink for washing later. "Wh- what?" I asked shakily, not understanding what was going on. Before I knew it I was being forced to step into a pair of plain white panties, and one of my special pairs of pants.

Mistress bought them for me. They fit me perfectly- they were tight, and perked up my butt. They were made of slightly tougher, thicker material, which meant that they got soaked better. And they were pure white- Mistress called them my 'potty pants'. She loved to watch me use these pants as my toilet, especially because of the color- they stained yellow very easily. And... brown. I had multiple pairs because they needed to be bleached between accidents. Here I was, hair still a mess from being in bed, no bra, no shirt, no socks even- just naked from the waist up, clothespins still on my puffy, sore nipples- wearing my white pants. Mistress chained me up to the wall, a set of chains that hung from the ceiling. The chains could be pulled up, forcing me to hang off the ground a few inches. Normally I enjoyed it, but not with someone else watching!

Mistress shed her robe, letting it drop to the floor, the silk pooling gently around her feet. Her friend whistled at her. "What an outfit," she commented. Mistress smirked back at her, and retrieved her riding crop- which she quickly used to switch me on the bottom. "AH!!" I cried out intensely- it hurt! She'd never hit me with this thing like that before! "THIS is what you get for disobeying me, not once, not twice, but THREE times!" Another CRACK of the crop across my butt, and I squealed in pain. The terror was rising in my throat again. It hurt... it hurt so much! CRACK! "AAH!!!"

The friend was looking over me curiously. "That looks fun and all, but shouldn't you just order her to do it?" She asked, and Mistress shook her head, smiling again. "She'll lose control," She said with confidence, reaching over and handing the blue woman her riding crop. "You go ahead." Her friend smirked her own condescending, toothy grin, and bent the crop between her fingers to test it. "Don't mind if I do-" And then it came again, the next CRACK!

I screamed in pain again, my head tilted back as I panted from the rush of endorphins. It was even WORSE with her handling it! I realized then that Mistress was a complete expert. She held back. Always punished me just past my breaking point, but this woman- she hated my people, and would do no such thing. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! She fired off a staccato of spankings, abusing, torturing my poor ass. I immediately began to cry. Big, pathetic, weepy tears of suffering. Boo-hooing and whining of the most pitiful of levels. Mistress's friend could only laugh. "Listen to her cry! Oh fuck, you are SUCH a pathetic piece of garbage! Cry harder!"

I felt it again. The panic in my throat, the quaking of my knees. The twisting. But thanks to the drug I must have been given last night, I didn't hold on for very long. Just one more spank later, and I was wetting my pants. Choking out whimpers of horror and despair. I had already wet my diapers earlier, so it wasn't a long soaking, but it was enough. Pee bloomed across the back of my thighs, like two long sweeping petal shapes that grew and grew. My white pants turned semi-translucent, started to turn yellow. Piss gushed down the inside of my thighs. It all dripped off the tip of my toes, suspended up above the floor- just enough to drip into a puddle on the floor at my feet about a foot in diameter.

~I- I did it again. Another woman made me wet myself,~ I thought. I thanked the goddess that Mistress prayed to, and Mistress herself. It was almost like the first time all over again- a completely exhilarating experience. Suddenly, I didn't think this girl was so bad. She made me wet my pants, after all. "Hah... hahah, look at that. That's just so sad. That's so disgusting. Are you a fucking child, seriously?" I then remembered why I didn't like the blue girl. I just squinted my eyes shut and took the beratement, it was all I could do. "Look at this once-proud elf, with all her magic and her history, and now she's chained to the ceiling fuckin' pissing in her pants. You should hate yourself. In fact, I can only imagine that you do hate yourself. Otherwise, you'd eventually kill yourself under this kind of torment, right? Maybe you ought to do it tonight!"

She reeled back her arm, and I was certain a whipping of unprecedented proportions was going to come, but as she swung her hand forward, it stopped- Mistress had grabbed her wrist. I looked over my shoulder, wondering when the blow would come, and that's when I saw it-

A look on Mistresses face that I never, ever wanted to see again.

She'd looked furious and disdainful at me before, but it wasn't anything like this. I was overwhelmed with the sheer killing pressure I felt from her. Believe it or not, even as utterly pathetic as I am, I have experienced killing intent before. This was like that, but worse... it was like there was something she could do that was worse than death, and she was going to do it.

"You overstep your boundaries, woman." Before her friend could even respond, Mistress reeled her hand back, punched her in the side of the jaw, and knocked her clean the fuck out. She crumpled like paper, a stupid, perplexed look of pain on her face, before she fell to the ground. Her face landed in my pee puddle, and this pleased me immensely. She left her on the floor and came over to me, caressing my hair, cupping my cheeks, cooing at me, assuring me everything was alright. "It's okay... yes, it's okay, you can cry... mmmhm... you poor, miserable thing. How adorable you looked hanging there, sobbing and wetting yourself. I burned the sight into my memory." She let me down from the chain, caressing my hair and pushing my face into her chest.

Once I got over the initial shock, I continued my crying session into Mistress's breasts. They felt comforting, even if they were firm and strong. I sobbed like that awhile... then, the next show began.

I was chained to the ceiling again, but this time, I was turned around so that I could see the opposite wall. Mistress's friend was chained to that wall. She was flat against the wall so that her wrists and face were forced against it- just barely enough room for Mistress to reach and squeeze her breasts. Her ankles were chained together at an awkward angle, with a medium sized spreader bar, but her knees were wrapped together. This forced her to stand against the wall with her bottom sort of out, and her tail flicked from side to side. She'd been left in her green pants, but her top had been removed entirely. She groaned groggily. "Unnhhh... what happened....?"

Mistress was standing behind me. She was watching the horned girl intently, holding something behind her back. With her other hand, she was freely caressing me, touching my chest. "You stepped much too far. You disrespected me immensely, after I did you the courtesy of inviting you into my home, and letting you play with my toys. You said something unforgivable to my lovely piss pants. Now I'm going to punish you."

The girl chained to the wall started to panic, her tail swish-swishing back and forth rapidly, pulling and struggling against her bonds. "W- wait-! I- I'm sorry!" She quickly apologized, and she sounded much meeker than before. This was when I realized that this wasn't the first time Mistress had 'punished' this particular friend. She huffed furiously, as she realized she wasn't getting out of it. "Sorry I didn't whip your plaything a little HARDER, that is."

Mistress said nothing. She merely stepped out from behind me, turned to plant a loving kiss on my cheek. "Watch very closely," She commanded me, and so, I did. She unfurled the leather whip she'd been holding behind her back, and in one smooth, expert motion, snapped it across the blue woman's back. I had never actually seen a real whip before- it sounded like a rifle shot. It sounded like the most painful thing I'd ever heard. An enormous welt was left across her 'friend's back, and she shrieked bloody murder. "AAAAIIIIEEEE!!" Her body cringed, her chest arched forward. She slumped against the wall, panting with exhaustion at having to deal with the pain.

"P... Please... please...." She whimpered, and Mistress ignored her. She whipped her across the back again, leaving another long welt, so there were two in the shape of an X. She hadn't broken the skin, but... it looked like she easily could. The woman screamed terribly again, and I flinched, feeling terrified myself. "No more! No more I'm sorry, please, PLEASE, I'm sorry Mistress, please!" She begged. "That's much better. You tried to call me by my name twice. You should know by now that to you, just as it is to her, my name is MISTRESS!!"

Mistress cracked her with the whip once more, and that was when she did it. I hadn't seen anything like it before- it wasn't like when I do it at all. There was this loud, filthy, wet noise- a sound sort of like 'PPPBBLLHHRRRRTTT!!', and suddenly, Mistress's 'friend' was having a complete accident in her pants. Urine gushed forcefully down the inside of her legs, poured off her bottom, drenched all over the back of her ankles. Her tail stuck straight up in the air, and a wet, mushy mound quickly grew in the seat of her pants as she shit herself. "AH! AHH!! AHH PLEASE NO, NOOOO!" She screamed again in pain. 'PRRBBHHTT! FLRRRPPHHTTT!' It just kept coming out. She was having an enormous poop in her pants.

And even then, Mistress did not stop. She continued to lay into her, crack after crack of her whip. It was actually terrifying to watch. It was so terrifying, I shuddered and whimpered. I felt that electricity down my spine, that twisting and churning in my gut and loins. I felt my pants tenting out. I felt the way that they pulled on my hips, as the tent in the seat of my pants stretched bigger, and bigger, and then- it fell into my panties. It was a big one, too... not quite as big as the hooved girl's pants pooping, but, I felt the weight of it in my panties tugging down more than I ever had before. It was so warm and filthy all over my butt. Just like every day... I shivered and shuddered. The stench in this room was so terrible. I was just as afraid of Mistresses whip, that I crapped my pants too, hanging from the ceiling.

Mistress reached over behind me with her free hand, not bothering to look as she cupped the enormous mound in the seat of my pants, pushing it against my bottom lightly. "What am I to do with the both of you? Looks like I have not one, but TWO disgusting girls who can't keep their pants clean."

Mistress wanted to play with me after that, so, after she deemed her 'friend' to have been sufficiently punished, she let her go... and kicked her out of the house, forcing her to go find her own change of pants, and walk down the road completely soaked and soiled. We played for some hours, after that... it had been such an exciting morning, after all, we couldn't let it go to waste. I didn't think I had ever been happier in my entire life to be alone in a room with another woman after relieving myself in my pants.

Following that day, every once in awhile, when I got up in the morning, or in the evening after my work was done, sometimes, I was chained up together with Mistresses draenei friend, and we would wet ourselves. All under the protective, authoritative gaze... of Her.

Thank you so much! I'm so excited to have some replies! I always appreciate comments and criticism especially, to try and better hone my style. It's really important to me.

I can't write if I don't have an audience

I like to bounce between warcraft and star wars fiction since those are the two games I've done lots of roleplaying in, but I've experimented recently with branching out into Elder Scrolls a little. However, today...

I'm going to write something that's entirely my own world. This sort of idea is something I've been bouncing around for awhile as part of something much larger and not really pee oriented that I've wanted to make for a long time. I was originally going to use this idea as a roleplaying setting, but I think it will flow smoother if I just write it as a story.

That being said, this story is going to be quite different. It's going to be a lot less shameless and a lot more horrible. So be warned:

The following content contains graphic imagery of terror, pain, suffering, gore, and death. You've been warned.

As with all my previous stories it also definitely has pants wetting and soiling as well.

Piss, Die, Repeat

(Chapter 1)

I awoke suddenly, gasping for breath and holding my chest. Intense pain wracked through me, radiating from my heart, and spreading across my chest and arms, down into my stomach. I felt I was going to be sick, doubled over sitting on my bed, unable even to scream as the air was caught in my lungs. I immediately rolled the upper half of my body to the side and vomited over the edge of the bed, but it was an empty dry heave, and only a strand of foamy spittle came out.

The pain began to subside, and I felt a cooling sensation running down my spine, originating in the base of my skull. It calmed me somewhat, and helped me to feel normal again. I was able to collect myself, swing my legs over the edge of the bed, and consult my surroundings. I was in a strange, sterile room- a cell, perhaps. The walls and the floor were all made of this same opaque white plastic, a bluish light radiating through it and lighting up my room with cold colors. The room was tiny- it was no wider than the length of my bed, and only about one and a half times that long. Just enough room so that I could stand up.

When I stood up, in front of me was a mirror, which ran from the floor to the ceiling. It had no border, nothing fancy- just a metallic sheet that showed me my own reflection. Printed on the mirror, so that it appeared above my head in my field of view, was a word. "Iyaori". I realized that was my name, Iyaori. Upon that realization, I realized something else- I had absolutely no memories of where I was, who I am, or what I was doing here. I didn't even recognize my own body in the mirror. So, this was me?

It appeared I was a young adult woman, maybe in her early twenties. Despite having no memories of the outside world, or anything at all, I somehow knew that. I knew that I was of foreign descent. My skin was a clear olive brown color, my eyes were like thin slits. My face looked attractive enough- perhaps average at best, but I was wearing black lipstick and violet eyeshadow that brought out the exotic look of my face. My face was more flat than it was angular- I had a small button nose, and my jaw was slightly rounded. I had black hair, tied up well and elegantly in a bun on top of my head. It shimmered in the pale blue light.

I looked down at my chest, reaching my hands up and cupping both of my breasts. I knew, for some reason, that I had a rather impressive set of breasts, and I also knew that this was important... that I could use my looks and body to my advantage, in society. Funnily enough, I didn't remember what a 'society' was. My first thought that I was in a prison cell was reaffirmed to me when I saw what I was wearing. Very simple clothes, white sneakers that were easy to move in, insulated powder blue leggings that hugged my proportions, and a simple shirt of the same color that had a chastely cut neckline. I did have one thing that stood out to me- I was wearing a strange earring.

It was attached to my upper earlobe- a thin silver strip with glowing blue lights on it. When I touched it, I realized that it was firmly attached to my ear- I could not take it off. Soon after touching the earring, the lights in my room came up brighter, with an audible hum. Then, I heard a voice.

"State your name." Another woman's voice- it resounded inside of my head. It didn't sound as if it were coming from the walls or my earring, but inside of my own skull- as if a voice was being transmitted directly into my brain. A panicked cry escaped me as I flinched and quickly turned, almost expecting someone to be behind me, but of course, there wasn't. "I- what am I doing here?" I asked.

"State your name," the woman's voice said again. Could she have been a machine? She certainly sounded like one. Her tone and intonation were monotonic. It sounded as if she had no emotions whatsoever. The voice of a middle aged woman, maybe? Ethereal and light, but sophisticated in pronunciation. Even though she had to repeat herself, she didn't seem angry. I looked at the name in the mirror again, and muttered out "I-.. Iyaori".

"Correct." Why did she even ask me if she already knew the answer? "What do you remember?" The voice continued to question me, and I looked around confused still, trying to spot the speaker it must be coming out from. Which was strange, because I didn't remember what exactly a speaker was.

"I-- I don't remember anything. What the fucking hell am I doing here?" I asked, panic giving way to irritation. I hadn't meant to say it like that, it just came out naturally. It seemed that whoever I was, I was foul mouthed. I looked at myself in the mirror again, and pursed my lips, looking analytically at myself. Something felt wrong. Despite the fact that I was looking in a goddamn mirror, I couldn't shake the feeling that this person that I was seeing was not who I really was. In fact, it felt odd to have the body of a woman, in the first place.

"You are here for examination," Miss Monotone replied to me. On cue, my name disappeared from the mirror. Some new symbols appeared on it, instead: The numbers 2, 3, 1- and three symbols above them that looked like so: I II III. "Touch the numbers and connotate them to the proper symbol," The voice commanded me. It was so laughably easy, that I just went ahead and did it without questioning it, in a number of seconds. "There. Am I done?" I asked impatiently. "No. You are not."

With a hiss of released gas, the panel of the wall next to the mirror pulled back, and retreated into a slot in the corner- it was apparently a door. "Proceed to the next test. You may not return to previously visited rooms. Ensure that you are ready." Looking back at the bed I laid on, searching through the pockets of the pants I wore, there was absolutely nothing that I could take with me. There weren't even sheets on the bed- it was just a foamy mattress. I even checked underneath the bed, just to be sure it wasn't a trick, and found nothing. So I shrugged, and proceeded through the door. A few tests, maybe I get some answers, then I'm done- that's what I thought.

How incredibly wrong I was.

As I stepped through the door, it hissed shut behind me, and I saw a light in the corner of my eye- I tried to look at it, but no matter where my eyes went, it stayed in the periphery of my vision. It was a number: "50".

"What does this number mean?" I asked, expecting the voice to have followed me. "You will deduce that later," She replied unhelpfully. "Prepare for the next test."

I wasn't completely prepared though, because as I stepped through the door I felt chill air blow mildly across my shoulders, and I shuddered, and realized the fullness of my bladder. "Hey, can I go pee first?" I asked, not thinking that saying that might have been embarrassing or rude. "That privilege is earned," I heard the voice say back to me, and I stared deadpan at the corner of the new hallway I was in. "Are you fucking serious?" I protested. "That privilege is earned," She replied back to me, so I just muttered angrily to myself. It wasn't really so bad, not an urgent need to go- I just didn't feel like solving more stupid math puzzles with a half-full bladder nagging at my mind.

Directly across from where I exited, there was another mirror. Just like before, it had three symbols on it: " I II III ". There was also a watch looking thing hanging from a hook in the wall- It looked pretty sleek, and I liked technology, so I put it on. A comfortable stretchy nylon band which had a sort of tablet attached to it. I touched the tablet, but nothing happened- it didn't even tell me the time. "What's this?" I asked Miss Monotone. "Touch the numbers and connotate them to the proper symbol," She told me. The same puzzle as last time?

Except, I looked all over the mirror, and there were no numbers. "There aren't any numbers here!" I complained, because of course there weren't. It seemed I was a bit whiny, as well. "You must find them. You will attach the numbers to your watch, and return them to the mirror." Looking to my left and right, I saw that I was indeed in a hallway larger than the room I had just been in. The walls were still that sterile white color. To my left, one hallway split into two- to my right, the hallway went around a corner. Since you always go right in mazes, another detail I didn't understand why I remembered, I decided to start with the one to my right.

"Hey, what am I taking these tests for? Do I get something out of it?" I asked, still trying to garner as much information as I can. "I cannot tell you the answer to that right now," She replied, and I gritted my teeth with irritation. "What can you tell me then!?" I yelled back at her, not expecting a reply. But to my surprise, she said- "Begin the Test. Touch the numbers and connotate-"

"I already fucking know that!"

My bodiless Virgil didn't seem interested in helping me do anything other than proceed through the tests, so I broke the silence by humming a tuneless song to myself. I probably shouldn't try singing. As I rounded the corner, pale light filled my eyes... "Oooh!" I exclaimed, pleased with what I saw. It was a terrarium. A rather large room- perhaps the size of a football field, which I definitely knew was used to play a game called 'football'. The ceiling appeared to be made of glass, and sunlight streamed through it, giving the forest inside much needed sunlight. It immediately evaporated away the strangeness of this situation. I could smell the dirt and the grass.

I could also see what looked to be some sort of... obstacle course. A test of my fitness, it would seem- up on a cliff at the back of the room, I could see another mirror, with a large number "2" on it. To get there, I would have to climb up a cliff face, jump across a series of pillars, swing across on a rope... it looked like a somewhat daunting challenge. I re-examined my legs and arms again, and to my pleasant surprise, saw that I was in pretty decent shape. I wasn't totally shredded, but it seemed like I was fit enough to do something like this, with exertion.

Thinking about that, I realized I didn't want to have to grunt and climb and jump my way around with my bladder filling up. I looked around to see if anyone was watching- which I would have never known. Of course, Miss Monotone had to be watching, but she was useless anyway! I didn't need to earn any sort of 'privilege', I could just piss in a bush. So I went over to the nearest copse, and put my hands on my waistband, to push my pants down over my butt and thighs. Only, when I tried... I found that what I thought was an elastic belt in my waistband constricted considerably. It was suddenly way too tight- I couldn't take them off!

"Ugh, what the f- what is this!? I can't even take off my clothes!?" I yelled back up at the faceless examiner in the sky. "That privilege is earned," She told me once again. "Proceed with the examination. You are wasting time." That last sentence had a little bite in it- even without hearing any emotion in her voice, I could tell she was getting annoyed. Well, I was getting annoyed too. "This is the dumbest bullshit- I can't even piss in a fucking bush!? What am I supposed to do when it's an emergency!?" I yelled back at her. "When you have reached your capacity, your body will naturally take care of that." I frowned as I thought about it, thinking maybe I might have some crazy power that made it so I never had to piss, when I realized it.

"Are you saying if I don't earn the 'privilege' to go and piss, my only option is to fucking piss my pants? You cannot possibly be implying that!" I stamped my foot in the grass, and my eyes widened at the response that I got. "Correct."

"You're fucking sick!" I yelled back at the woman. "Your bodily concerns are not concerns of ours. Earning privileges is your stimulation to proceed through the tests. As I informed you earlier, you are wasting time. This test does not have a time limit, but the time that you spend bickering will cost you in the future. Now- proceed."

I was furious, but I also knew that further arguing would get me nowhere. If I wanted anything in this insane place, I supposed I would have to earn it. So, I got started, climbing the cliff face. It wasn't the easiest thing to do, and it was a little scary with no ropes to support me, but I got through it. By the time I made it to the top, I had forgotten entirely that I needed to relieve myself. I guess I didn't really have to go that bad, at that point. With the knowledge that I was strong enough to do it, I made it through the rest of the challenge, climbing up onto the grassy knoll at the top of the hill. I approached the mirror, and instinctually touched the number, and then touched it to my watch. The number on the mirror faded, and the number "2" appeared on my watch, in cyan. "Alright, got it," I said to myself as I returned to look over the obstacle course I had passed.

As I was looking down at it, the landscape began to shift. The pillars I had hopped over, the cliff I climbed up- The whole room rumbled, and I fell down on my butt. Dirt and rocks started to pour down into a crevasse, and a beam rose up- angled so that the top of the beam was where I was on the hill, and the bottom was where I had started. I would have to balance on the beam somehow, and make it all the way down there, which was pretty far. Not to mention, that underneath the balance beam... were spikes.

Sharp, narrow spikes filling the crevasse. I could see them glinting back at me, taunting me with their deadliness. If I fell off the balance beam, there was no way I wouldn't get gored on them. "N-No way," I trembled, powerfully reminded of my need to urinate once again. I shook my head, looking down at it. "There's no fucking way you expect me to cross that thing to get back! Let me go back down the way I climbed up at least!" I looked toward the edges of the hill, but half of the forest had fallen away- there was no way across other than that beam.

"You must cross the beam to continue. Proceed." This insane woman seriously expected me to cross this, all in the name of some weird 'examination'!? "No! Absolutely not! I refuse! Cancel the test, I want out! I want to go home!" My paranoia mounted, worried I might accidentally slip on the grass and fall into the pit of spikes anyway. I scrambled back, staying sitting down, kicking the dirt with my feet. "You are currently incapable of cancelling the examination. You are welcome to remain where you are, safe and out of immediate danger."

I sniffled a little and dry swallowed, looking back up at the ceiling, wondering if she was watching me through it. "So if I just wait here eventually it will end?" I asked- a stupid question. At that point, I had not understood at all what was going on. "Correct. You are perfectly allowed to sit on this ledge and wait until you die of starvation."

It was starting to click now. It made sense. The harsh restrictions, the need to earn 'privileges'. The jail cell like room I had awoken in. This was not a test that was 'optional'. This was not a simple measurement of my capabilities. The test may not have even been FOR me- I was simply a subject in it. This was no test at all. It was some sort of insane death game. "Four other examinees have chosen this option in the past," The insane, emotionless lady told me, and I looked up sharply. "Other examinees- you mean I'm not alone in here?" I asked her, desperate to get help from someone. "Correct. In this entire facility, there are over one-thousand, three hundred and eighty four other examinees. Out of that number, sixty three have died."

Sixty three people dead, out of about a thousand and a half... dead because of this crazy test. The nervousness built in my throat, and I swallowed to keep it back down. Hesitantly, I crawled forward, and reached out to touch the balance beam. I shook it. It seemed pretty sturdy, and I could grip it well. Nobody said I had to walk down the entire thing- so I crawled onto it, and started to inch my body forward down it, bit by bit. I refused to die here. As I made my way across, I saw the number in the corner of my field of vision increase- it ticked up to 70. "What does this number mean? Why did it go up?" I asked, thinking that maybe if I could just talk with Miss Mad Scientist, I might be able to distract myself from what was certain death below me.

"You have gained support from a sponsor as a result of your actions," She replied. "Support? What do you mean support? Sponsors? Are there other people watching me!?" I had to stop to pause on the balance beam. I couldn't believe I damn near dropped my pants and urinated in a bush with who knows how many people watching. I blushed furiously, gritting my teeth to try and stave off the mixture of shame and terror. "I cannot tell you the answer to that right now. You must proceed with the examination."

Bit by bit, inch by inch, I wormed my way across the balance beam. All I had to do was keep my head up. Don't look down, never look down at the spiky death below me. My palms were growing sweaty without my realizing it- On my next crawl forward, my hand slipped and I lost my grip on the balance beam. I screamed and clenched on tight with my thighs, my heart racing with panic- and wet myself. It was only just a little- just a spurt into my panties, but it was enough that it showed through the crotch of my tight powder blue leggings, a little apple sized damp splotch. My flush of humiliation got worse- and I saw the number in the corner increase again. "You have gained more support from a sponsor as a result of your actions." The number was now... 192!? It had more than doubled!

"Wh- what actions?" I asked, curious, hoping that it was because I nearly died and caught myself. Maybe they were impressed with my determination. "I cannot tell you the answer to that right now." I grumbled, grimaced, and kept inching my way across the beam. My groin dragged on it as I held on tight with my thighs, and I could feel my wet gusset rubbing up against my lady parts. I was briefly struck with the idea that it felt strange to have a vagina, and I didn't know why. In the end, my determination won out, and I made it across the beam- gingerly putting my hand on the grass, afraid it too would fall out from underneath me. I hopped off the beam and onto the greenery, and sighed with relief, running my fingers through the blades of grass.

My number increased to 218. "You have gained support from a sponsor as a result of your actions." Trying to glance at the number in my periphery, I frowned at the only slight increase. What- I risk my life in a crazy athletic stunt and I only get a measly fucking 26 points? But I got over a hundred for peeing- No, that wasn't it, I got those points because of the near death experience! Maybe this wasn't a test at all, but actually entertainment for people. My confidence surged once again as I survived the harrowing task, and I proceeded down the hall at a brisk gait, to connect the 2 with the hallway mirror and move on to the next room. "Please tell me the next room is not as dangerous," I murmured.

"You may spent twenty of your points for advice," The mysterious woman said as I crossed into the next room. "Really?" I said as I examined the next room I was in. It seemed I was to climb down a ladder into a glass maze. The maze was made up of a series of blocks. I climbed down and pushed on one of the blocks, and it lit up purple, and slid away from me with a whoooom. It seemed the point was to move these blocks in such a way that I could navigate through the maze. But if it was anything like the last test... "O-Okay," I stammered, worried about what the next consequence would be. "Go ahead. I want the hint."

The number tracked back down to 198- it seemed that earning points allowed me to get hints. Maybe that was the point of them? Or maybe they could be used for something else. "My advice is this: Hurry." On cue, the ladder that I had climbed down shot back up, retracting with a hiss. A glass panel slid into place- I appeared to be locked in here. I panicked, and looked around sharply. This was going to be impossible without being able to see the maze from above! However, as I looked around, I noticed the panel of my watch- it was showing me what the block maze looked like from above, with a little yellow dot indicating where I was. "What the fuck do you mean, hurry!? I could have figured that out for myself! I want my points back!"

"Okay... so this puddle- uh, this puzzle is solvable," I tried to calm myself down. If it was solvable, that meant I could escape. And if I could escape the maze, I might get to go pee. As I took a step, I heard a wet splash on my shoe, and I gasped, looking down- no way! I didn't have to go so bad I wet myself without even NOTICING, did I? But upon further inspection, it appeared the puddle did not come from me. It was spreading out across the floor... getting bigger... millimeter by millimeter, rising up. My asshole clenched and I gritted my teeth, eyes going wide- that was what she meant by 'hurry'. If I took my sweet time like I did with the last one, I would drown.

Frantically, I started to push blocks, checking my watch and pushing blocks over and over again. The puzzle itself wasn't entirely complicated, but it was lengthy- I wasn't just clearing a path straight forward. I had to wind around back to push blocks into open slots, so that I could move the blocks ahead of me- they wouldn't move if there was something in front of them. I was reliant entirely on the watch- I had a simple enough plan, yes, this was working so far- without looking, I reached up to push the next block I needed to move. But the surface of the block wasn't smooth, like the others.

It was sharp. Razor sharp. Instead of a flat colored surface, there was a depression which contained razor sharp knife points, sticking out. And, unwittingly, I had just gored my hand on one of them. It burned, it burned so hot as my blood poured out and over my palm- the knife was thick. I gasped and screamed in terrible pain as I sharply yanked and pulled my hand back. It was rather severely injured- the knife had cut directly between my middle and ring finger, about a quarter of the way into my palm. Blood was gushing out of it. I didn't realize that humans bled this much.

"Oh god! Oh my fucking god!!" I screamed, holding my hand, crying in shock and pain. I lost control of my bladder, much more intensely this time, from the panic. Pee soaked down the inside of my legs, and made it all the way to just about my knees before I grimaced and clenched my guts and forced myself to stop. "Wh- what am I supposed to fucking do about this!? What do I do!?" The water from below me had risen up to my knees, as well. Realizing I had wet myself, I crouched down to soak myself from the waist down in the water. Maybe if I was quick enough, nobody would notice that I peed. In the corner of my eye, I saw my number tick up to 331. "Another sponsor? I just opened up my fucking hand! Is that what you FREAKS wanted to see? You want to see me bleed!"

"I suggest you hurry, once again," The emotionless bitch told me, and I snapped back at her. "What am I supposed to DO!? I'm going to bleed out!!" I yelled back at her. I quickly grabbed my fingers with my other hand, squeezing them together to try and close the wound. "The human body contains an average of ten pints of blood. You will lose roughly a pint of blood from an open wound like that within an hour. Less, if you continue to hold the wound shut. Fatal anemia occurs upon losing more than one third of your blood. Your statistical chances of dying from blood loss due to a wound like that are less than 7%. Continue the exam. I do suggest you hurry. Blood loss is not your main concern right now."

I hated the woman even more, but she was right. I was going to drown if I didn't hurry it up. I now knew better- you couldn't push blocks from certain sides, and there were spikes to punish you if you hurried too fast and didn't watch what you were doing. The water sloshed around my thighs as I pushed block, after block. I felt like I still had an eternity to reach the end, and the water was now up around my waist, and I was wading through it. Hurry... I had to hurry....

Despite the rising water levels, the blocks still moved at the same speed. I thanked god for that as I reached out with both my hands, still holding my wound shut above water, and pushed the last block out of the way. I was outright swimming now- only my head remained above water. But there it was- the end. I prayed that I didn't need to make it back upon obtaining the number 1--

As I touched the number, it jumped straight to my wristwatch. I could hear something churning in the corners of the room, and the steady trickling of water into my caged glass maze stopped. I turned around, breathing a sigh of relief. I was going to live. My numbers rose once again, up to 362. The glass enclosure opened back at the end I had come in, and the ladder lowered. I started to make my way over, when I realized... "Wait, you're not going to lower the water levels? I'm practically swimming through this here!"

"Your physical actions are none of our concern. Proceed with the examination."

As I climbed up the ladder and out of the water, the cool air I had felt earlier washed over me, and I shuddered, soaked all over other than my hair. I wished that I could be warm, and as I passed back out into the hallway, as if answering my prayers- three panels in the archway slid open, and out came glowing, bright red coils. "What the-" I paused hesitantly, wondering if I was going to be incinerated- when I felt an incredibly intense blast of hot air washing over me. "Ahh!" I cried out in shock- the hot air was intense! I clutched my wounded hand, and felt my skin and face growing hot. The winds were so intense, I couldn't even move forward- moments later, it was already over. Huffing from the experience, I looked down at myself, to find my clothes completely blown dry. I was glad for that- no more gross piss stain between my legs, even if it was just a little dribble.

At least, it was at first.

I returned to the wall, and grimaced as I let go of my hand to touch the wristwatch, and transmit the number 1 into its correct place. The bleeding had slowed considerably, but I could feel the clot trying to form tearing apart just from my hand's natural finger position. "Can't I do something about this now?" I asked. In answer to my request, a shining box appeared in the side of the mirror, away from the door puzzle. "Yes. You may spend points on a first aid kit for your hand. You will have to apply the stitches yourself." I glanced down at the points... 362. "How much?" I crossed my fingers on my other hand, hoping for good luck...

"Three hundred and fifty points," The bitch told me. I gritted my teeth- that was nearly all of them. And who knew if I would need to use them on the next puzzle, too? "Don't you have anything cheaper?" I asked, regretting that I hadn't been paying attention and stupidly got hurt this way. "A strip of cloth to bandage the wound and tie your fingers together. Fifty points."

"Deal," I said.

As the words left my mouth, the square on the mirror erased itself, a bright light starting in the corner and going around all four edges of the square. That section of the mirror slid back, and revealed a small compartment, which contained the strip of cloth rolled up in a ball. It wasn't as nice as stitches and gauze, but it would have to do. This place seemed pretty clean, so I wasn't worried about infection... I knew infections were something that happened to injuries, but I didn't exactly remember what one felt like. The cloth was clean, too- simple, but clean. I expected it to be grimy, or something.

The final test room was smaller than the maze and the forest. It was a room about forty by twenty feet. It had more of a dungeon like feel to it- the floor was made of sandstone, and was full of narrow holes. The light in the room gave it a yellowish orange color. I didn't see any kind of puzzle in here- just a long, rectangular glass that separated me from the mirror in the back of the room. As I approached the mirror, the archway I passed through to get inside closed behind me suddenly, just like with the glass maze. So I was trapped in here now, instead. "What's next, poison gas?" I asked with a roll of my eyes, and to answer my question, the ceiling shuddered, split down the middle, and retracted into the sides of the room. Like the pit in the forest room, I couldn't see the top of the ceiling, it was shrouded in darkness. What I DID see, were dozens of razor sharp spikes, thick like swords, just like the one I had opened my hand with.

I swallowed and my knees knocked together, staring up at them, feeling like they'd drop down and gore me at any moment. Even after the little release I had in the drowning maze, I was once again firmly reminded of the need growing in my bladder. I looked back to the mirror, and saw it change. There were sixteen little boxes, scattered in random points across the mirror. "Wait! Wait I want to spend points on a hint!" I yelled back up to the woman in charge of all this. Without even a confirmation response, I saw my 312 points drop down to 292. "It is a puzzle of memory. If you are lucky, you are allowed three tries."

"Lucky!?" I asked, when I saw the mirror flash, and draw my attention to it. The boxes on the mirror were filled with numbers- one through sixteen. In the center of the screen was a large number 5- and it began counting down. 4... 3.... I realized immediately what I had to do, and tasked myself to the memorization. It was over in a blink of an eye and the number squares were covered with white, like they were behind a panel, and I cursed. I had managed to look at them all the way up to fourteen, but I didn't see where fifteen or sixteen were. Not to mention, could I even remember this!?

Looking up at the knives once again, my hand shook as I reached out... and tapped the first square. The number "1" was revealed, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Quickly I got to two, three, four. Then, when I pressed the next panel in the sequence, instead of revealing the number, a red "X" appeared across the box. I gasped and covered my head with my arms, thinking maybe they would save me from the knives, and screamed as a number of them dropped and pierced the ground. However... none had fallen on top of me. I looked around- the swords had fallen in random locations. I was safe. For now... and stuck on the number five. When I looked back up to the ceiling, the holes where the swords had already fallen were being refilled with more swords. "Great," I muttered. "I can't even hide in the spots where they already fell."

I took a deep breath, and released it. I could do this... I just was going too fast. I remembered now that five was to the LEFT- reaching out, and confidently touching it. I breathed again and went back to the next panel that I had made the mistake on- six. I was certain that it had to be six. I fought with myself over it- I was running out of time, mentally. I would forget where the other ones were if I didn't hurry, so I pressed it.

I got the red "X" again.

I quickly looked up toward the ceiling and saw that the swords were coming loose and falling again- much more than last time, and this time, one was going to fall right on top of me! I screamed and slid out of the way in a panic, not realizing that I could have moved into the path of other spikes- luckily, I didn't, and the one that would have pierced me right through pierced into the floor instead, right into the little narrow hole so it could slide away and be replaced. For some insane kind of death trap, this examination hall was terribly intricate. The shock of almost being gored must have awoken something in me, because I immediately remembered where six was, selected it- and kept going.

Nearly dying can be quite the jump-start to the brain. When survival is the priority, it's amazing what you can do, mentally. I was able to remember clearly now- seven, eight, nine- having to walk down to the other side of the mirror for the other squares. Ten, eleven, twelve- moving back toward the center to get thirteen, fourteen... and now... the final two. They were right next to each other. And the worst part of it all, I hadn't looked at them. I didn't know which one was which at all- not even a slight inkling.

I stared at the two squares for what seemed like forever, trying to see past the white light that obscured their numbers from view. I screwed my eyes shut and tried to remember what the whole board looked like when I saw it, but it was no use. I just couldn't remember. It had to be one... or the other. I had a 50/50 chance- I had to pick one. If I didn't pick any, I would just be trapped in this room forever and starve to death. I remembered what the mystery psychopath told me. "If you are lucky, you are allowed three tries." This was my third try- which meant if I messed it up, I was out of tries. And I had a bad feeling I knew what happened if I messed up my third try.

Death. It would be unavoidable. A third of the swords fell the first time I made a mistake- two thirds fell the second time. That meant if I failed this time... I looked up at the ceiling. They were too narrowly spaced together. There was nowhere that I could stand to avoid them if they all fell down. My life- everything hung on this 50/50 bet. I had felt sure I had made dangerous bets in the past, and gotten a rush from them, but I got no rush at all from this. I got terror. Utter, mind consuming terror. The fear of failure, the fear of death- it ruled me. My hand pulsed from the pain where it had been injured... being stabbed in just the hand hurt this bad, what would it feel like to have my entire body gored? Would I die right away?

"You would not die immediately," The disembodied voice of the woman I hated most in the world popped up, like she was reading my mind, "If all the spikes fell. Their weight is not enough that gravity would allow them to pierce your skull. You would only die immediately if one stabbed your brain through your eye, the statistics of which are low. The pain would be intense. If the shock did not kill you, blood loss would. However, depending on how you are stabbed, dying from blood loss could take nearly fifteen minutes."

"I- I didn't n-need to k-know th-- that," I stammered, tripping over my tongue, nervousness and fear tying up my words. I was too afraid to even yell about it. My fingers hovered over the two panels. One was life. The other, death. One was success. The other, failure. I had to just guess- I had to go for it. I picked the one on the bottom, and started to move my finger toward it. It was as if something was pushing me back- the invisible force of sheer terror, holding my finger. My breathing got heavier and more ragged. I was sweating profusely, and my heart raced faster and faster. I felt this tremor, this spasm deep in my loins, and hot, hot wetness burst across my lap and groin. It gushed down my legs, I felt the wetness spread to my butt. I felt the streams of it running down the inside of my legs, soak into the thick legging fabric, and make it cling wetly to me.

I couldn't stop it. Not this time. My knees bent ever so slightly as I tried to force myself to press the button, which made me piss my pants even harder. I could hear the gushing, hissing ssssshhhhhhsssssss of my bladder forcibly emptying itself. I could hear the sound of pee gushing between my legs splattering on the floor. It soaked into my sneakers and my feet felt wet. I was wet all the way from my pussylips down to my heel- completely, utterly soaked. I stood there trembling, bladder empty, pee still dripping down the cloth of my pants. Too intent on trying to force myself to do this, I didn't even notice my number of points skyrocket up to 644. I screwed my eyes shut, and forced my finger forward.

I waited for the inevitable. If I was going to die like this, I didn't want to see. I swallowed, and waited for what felt like an eternity. I opened one eye just a crack... and saw it. The number fifteen. I had done it- I prevailed. I let out the breath I was holding, and moved my hand up to the last square- sixteen, and I was done. With the tension gone, I looked down at my completely peed in pants, and my lower lip quivered, making a face of disgust and shame. I slinked forward, to go and obtain the final number- the number 3- and started to slowly slink back down the hall, too disgraced to have any energy.

I stood in front of the mirror, about to assign the number to its mark. "It seems you've wet yourself," I heard the terrible woman's voice in my head. I looked away and covered my lap with both hands, not that it would help anything. "I- I d- didn't..." I tried to say, more an effort to convince myself, really. "There is no benefit to lying. Furthermore, we all witnessed it happen. Based on our data, we predicted an 83.433% chance you would wet yourself in fear before the third examination. Our data is rarely incorrect."

I covered my hot, pink face with both hands, screwing my eyes shut and squatting down, making myself as small as I felt, mortified to even be having this conversation. With my eyes shut like this, I missed out on my points raising to 707. I tried to choke back a sniffle- but I couldn't help but weep into my hands. This was so utterly demeaning to me- I couldn't take it, and had to cry for just a few seconds. This caused my points to rise to 749. Again- I did not notice.

"Can... can I change... or something?" I begged, sniffing and wiping away my tears with the heel of my good palm. My legs wobbled, but, I managed to stand. "You lack the points and progress for this request. You may spend 600 points, to have access to a blow-drier for three minutes."

"Six- Six hundred!?" I snapped back. What a ridiculous amount! "I only had like, three hundred when I-" That was when I noticed how high my points had climbed.

749... why? Why did they sponsor me so much? What did I do? Was it because I solved the puzzles and finished this examination? Or was it because... of what I had done? Because I got so scared, that I... that I wet myself? A revulsed grimace turned into a scowl as I thought about it. That would make the most sense. This was all entertainment for them, wasn't it? Not some kind of TEST. They awarded me points when I hurt myself, when I humiliate myself. The points are incentive to see me suffer. I understood, now.

I sniffed and wiped my tears away. I wouldn't let them take it from me. I needed these points. Who knows what else I could get with them? I'd gotten so much- if I carelessly blew all the points I had, I wouldn't have them later when I really needed them. Which meant that... I would just have to deal with it. "No... no thanks," I murmured, and pressed the symbol to assign the number 3 to it. "Very well." At least the emotionless psycho bitch wasn't rubbing it in or making fun of me.

The mirror absorbed the puzzle, like the one in my little jail cell had, and nearby it, a section of the wall hissed with some kind of cold gas, and retracted itself into the wall- sliding itself aside, to allow me entryway through. "Proceed to the next examination." I trudged along, disgusted at the wet squish in my shoes from every little step that I took. It was starting to grow cold, and clammy. My skin already felt dry, and irritated- no doubt I was going to end up with a rash because of this. The next room I entered was another hallway, a fair bit longer than the rest. Looking down at my feet, I dragged my fingers of my good hand along the wall, plugging onward.

At some point, the floor and the walls were no longer made of the clean, white, plastic looking material. They had been converted into stone. Grey, dank stone, not unlike some sort of miserable dungeon. I looked up, and saw that the hallway spread out into a large room. It was as dungeon like as it could get- mold forming in the crevices of the bricks. Water dripping from the ceiling in places. I had entered a square room, relatively empty and abandoned looking. Broken casks, a single chair. A few shelves that had dusty, ancient bottles on them. Suddenly, the wall behind me slammed shut, and I screamed, twisting myself around to look at it. It seemed there was no going back, after all.

"This examination is simple. Find the five symbols, and apply them to the correct spots on the exit mirror. There are no challenges in this testing area- you simply must hunt down and find the symbols, decipher them, and put them in their correct places. Once five minutes have passed, we will introduce incentivization to complete the puzzle faster." I listened carefully to her instructions, this time- This place made me feel uneasy, and I wanted to know exactly what I was getting into. "What... what do you mean by incentivization?"

"You will deduce that later," My tormentor instructed my cryptically. "Begin the Examination, Iyaori." Glancing down at my wristwatch, I saw five boxes appear on it- it seemed that I didn't need to collect the symbols one by one, I could snatch them all up at once. Above the boxes, a timer began counting down, from 5:00:00. Anxiety consumed me- I didn't want to find out what they meant by 'incentivization', so I started off at a run, searching through the area.

The dungeon was large, but not TOO large. About eight rooms and three hallways, all connected to each other in an asymmetrical pattern. The hallways were fairly free of clutter, other than some barrels and boxes in the way, so I set about searching the rooms. Quickly enough, I found the first symbol- and was utterly perplexed by it. It didn't make any sense- it wasn't a roman numeral. It was sort of like a weird star, in a way- a sequence of 5 lines at 90 degree angles to each other from a center point. I stared at it in the watch, trying to make sense of it- flicking my eye up and noticing that I had only 3:39:52 remaining. I really didn't want to find out what would happen, so I continued to rush through the rooms. The symbols weren't easy to find- I just happened to luck upon the first one. They weren't always on a wall, or a door, or a shelf.

I found the next one inside of a box. It was a rather large box- it looked like I could fit inside of it. Now that I noticed that, I looked around the rooms in the dungeon- several of the rooms contained large boxes, cabinets, or armoires that I could have fit inside of. I had no frame of reference, but I guessed that I must not be very tall. Either that, or this dungeon was designed with gigantic people in mind. I found the next one under a chair seat- this one had a series of lines with curve-like waves. I wasn't seeing the pattern at all.

Two left to find. That... that was when I heard it. During my search, I had found one door, about two rooms away from the exit mirror, that I couldn't get into. I thought nothing of it at the time. But, just as I was passing through that room, glancing down at my watch to see that I had only 1:27:33 remaining, the door that was locked suddenly slammed and shuddered. I sucked in air and stifled a gasp, covering my mouth and staring at the door in a panic. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. There... there was something on the other side. It was trying to beat the door down, and from the strength of its blows, it was going to succeed. I began to smell a horrible, rotten stench. I gagged, and scurried away to a different room, not wanting to be in that one anymore- carefully and quietly closing the door behind me. Looking at the door I closed, I realized that it had a lock on it- so I locked it. Maybe I could trap it for long enough to escape.

I found the fourth symbol behind a dresser drawer in that room. I was moving more slowly now- I was trying to creep, to be stealthy. I didn't know if this thing could be avoided, but they couldn't have expected me to solve a puzzle while being chased by someone, could they? I could hear the hammering slams coming faster, and faster. I heard the sound of wood splintering. I looked down at my watch- four symbols, one to go- and 00:11:09 remaining on the timer. I covered my mouth firmly, stifled my breathing as I hid in the dark, two rooms away. I heard the sound of the door shattering into pieces. I heard the sound of wet, slimy, disgusting feet pounding heavily on the stone ground. I heard a moan in two voices, one low and guttural, the other high pitched and whimpering.

I now had to complete my search in perfect silence, or risk being discovered. I slunk along the corridor, trying to put some distance between us. Fuck searching- for the time being, I was going to hide and stay away! I could hear its feet shuffling, the sound of clinking chains. I could tell where it was from at least a few rooms away. I would go to where I couldn't hear it, and search there. If I heard it coming, I'd go out a different way- all rooms except one had at least two ways out. Of course, the fucking exit mirror would be in the room where there's only one way in or out.

This test suddenly became much harder, and much more horrifying than the last ones, even with their razor sharp death traps. I didn't want to imagine what they had found to 'incentivize' me with. Unfortunately... I didn't have to imagine. I made a mistake. I was searching through one of the rooms, when suddenly, I heard the rattling of the doorknob behind me. It was right fucking there- right outside the room I was in. I didn't realize that IT could sneak too, to try and surprise me. I looked left and right- I didn't have time. If I made it to the door, it would spot me. So I hastily ducked down behind some barrels, in the corner- begging god, whoever that was, to let it go past me. I watched the door through a crack between the barrels, and what I saw...

I almost vomited. It was no longer anything remotely human or animal. It was both. It walked on two legs, like a man- if one could call them legs. The left thigh was enormously tumorous and bulbous, covered in burst open sores. The right leg had no foot, it walked on a bloody stump. The torn, tattered burlap cloths did almost nothing to cover the sight of his skin, fat and rippling with muscle in its chest and gut. The thing was covered in putrid lacerations- from head to toe, all over its body, like the victim of some horrible factory accident. A chain dragged behind him on his left ankle, presumably having originally changed his legs together, but missing his right foot, it had fallen off that leg.

It's head was inhuman. Half the face of a man, the corner of his mouth drooped eternally in a paralyzed groan. Half the face of a dog, fur and skin removed, only bare red flesh dripping with blood. The human half moaned its agony, while the dog half snorted and snapped at the air. Between their two heads was a gap, an empty space where their skulls were cleaved open- half the brain of each, man and beast, had been surgically attached together, and exposed to the air. Its right hand, much thicker and stronger than the other, carried a pockmarked, rusty axe. Not a simple axe used for chopping wood, but a brutal executioner's weapon, with sharp spikes and blood grooves. Rusty as it was, the edge was still razor sharp, despite being chipped in some places, giving the weapon a serrated edge.

Urine trickled down the inside of my thighs as I knelt behind the barrels. It wasn't much, considering that I had only recently had an accident, but my horror and revulsion compelled me to urinate as hard as I could. The cold clamminess felt warm again against my pussy and between my thighs, for a few moments. My points rose up to 812. I watched the creature drag itself through the room, stopping and turning its head from side to side. It drew near to my corner of the room. I made myself as tiny as I could, far back in the dark corner. I silently begged for anyone who would listen, to just let him move on. I wasn't watching him anymore- I couldn't risk being seen between the slats of the barrels. I covered my mouth with both hands, and held my breath. I could have sworn he was staring directly into my hiding place...

But it worked. I could hear the chain rattle behind him as he slinked off, to shuffle and groan his way through the dungeons in search of me. As utterly revulsed as I was by the sight of him, I felt a bit of relief knowing that he was missing a foot. Likely, I could outrun him, if I had to. That was when I peeked out from behind the barrels, to see which room he would head towards next... and I found what I was looking for. The final rune.

It was engraved into his back.

I went into the fetal position up in my dark little corner, covering my mouth tightly, tears streaming down my cheeks as I cried, wept bitterly and frightenedly at the knowledge that if I wanted to get through this... I had to touch his back. I couldn't do it- I just couldn't do it. I was certain, at that point, that I was going to die here. Terrified to the point of pissing my pants again, crying in this corner, a flash of hot red anger ran through me when I saw that my points went up yet again, to 845.

One way or another, I would die. If I did nothing, hid and wept, I would eventually be found. If I played hide and seek with him forever and ever, I would grow exhausted, be found, and be killed. I had only one choice remaining, even if I had only a 5% chance of success... I had to touch his back, make it to the door, assign the symbol, and escape. My mind raced trying to think of ways I could do it- I could throw something to distract him... touch the rune and run away as fast as I could. The armoires and chests... yes, I could hide in one of those, then sneak to the door when he was far away from it. I could do it.

First, I had to make it to the mirror room, and hope that he didn't go inside. I needed to solve the puzzle as much as I could- give myself as much time as I could. Remembering my mistake from before, I tracked him carefully. I whispered a prayer of thanks that my shoes didn't squeak on the damp stones of the dungeon. I waited until his search was well on the other side of the dank halls, and crept into the mirror room. When I got close to it, I saw the boxes light up on the mirror, and my stomach sank. I only had to find 5 symbols.... but there were 10 random numbers on the door. My chances of correctly picking the right number by guessing were cut in half. I HAD to figure the symbols out. I squinted at the first one I picked up, the one that had the five 90 degree angles coming out of a central point. From the central point, there were five lines... and, as it was, there was a number 5 on the mirror. So, I tapped that symbol, and tapped the number 5.

The symbol appeared on top of the number, and flashed red- returning itself to my wristwatch. I cursed- the answer must have been more complicated than that. Just as I was about to try to guess again, everything went to hell.

The mirror started to chime a loud, irritating klaxon. WEEEERP. WEEEEERP. WEEEEEERP. I gasped and looked up at it, saw the lights on it flashing, the deafening sound it was making- tears streaked down my cheeks again as I realized what my failure had cost me. The mirror betrayed me. 843 points. I ran over to the door to try and escape the mirror room and hide somewhere else- when I heard the thunderous stomping of the beast's feet, the rattle of his chain. Fast- faster than I possibly imagined. It ran into the middle of the next room and grunted and groaned at me monstrously. It had found me. His disgusting two heads stood a whole two heads over me. The cancerous, blistered left leg was as thick as I was around the waist.

He didn't attack me right away, though I was clear in his line of sight. I was frozen to the spot, riveted there with sheer dread, eyes as wide as they could get. I couldn't stop shaking, my entire body was shaking- my stomach churned, and I immediately shit my pants. Filthy, wet and messy crackling erupted from my backside- I completely exploded into my panties, a gassy PRRRAAPPHHTT resounding from my rectum and echoing throughout the chambers. I watched my points climb, and climb, and climb- all the way up to 1,477. As if that were his cue, he started to shuffle forward to back me against the wall. I cried and shook my head. "No no no no no, no, oh no, oh no," I kept whimpering to myself. He reeled his weapon back, and I put my hands up in front of my face to defend myself, screwing my eyes shut.

I heard something wet thud against the ground. My body was pumped so full of adrenaline, at first, I didn't recognize what it was. I didn't feel pain. But as I opened my eyes, saw him standing over me... saw my stump. My arm. He'd cut off my right arm, in the middle of the forearm. Blood was gushing out of me and running all over the stump of my remaining arm. The pain set in then- it was a searing, burning, fire of blood. Though I remembered nothing about my life, I knew that this was the most intense pain I had ever, ever felt.

I screamed in agony- I shrieked at the top of my lungs. The beast reeled back, the dog-side of his head barking and crying in pain, and I took the opportunity to bolt under his arm. I made it into another room and yanked the door shut behind me, locking it- immediately the monster started to chop the door into pieces with his gore axe. I ran, and I ran, and I made it through three more rooms. That chest- the one where I found the third rune. I immediately went inside it and pulled the lid shut, not caring that I was sitting in a wet, reeking, shitty mess in my pants.

I gritted my teeth and sobbed insanely, hyperventilating, trying to make myself silent- grabbing my wrist stump, squeezing it as hard as I could, maybe I could get it to stop bleeding long enough to try again, it was the only thought I had in my mind- I had to survive. I had to survive! Trembling in that little box, I was enveloped in the stench of my accident, I couldn't breathe. Sitting in there like that, I was forcibly pissing and messing my pants as hard as I could- but I was empty, so nothing came out, even though the urge wouldn't abate.

"This isn't good at all. Your chances of survival are quite low." Now she wanted to speak to me? I was still sobbing hysterically, and I spat back at her, "Shut up! It'll find me! I'm dead, I'm going to die, I-I'm dead-"

"Not to worry. He cannot hear my communication to you. I'm speaking inside of your head. Regardless, that isn't going to save you. We estimated a 100% probability that, if you did not wet yourself in the last test, you would during this. We also estimated a 91.11% probability you would soil your pants." I wiped my face with my hand, letting go of my bleeding stump for just a moment, silent tears continuing to stream down my face, plastered with tears and blood and snot. "Wh, wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-- what do I do?" I heard him limping his bloody leg through the halls, he was getting closer. I jumped as I heard the door to the very room I was in get smashed open. I could hear his tormented moans. I could hear him slowly dragging himself deeper into the room.

"There is no longer anything you can do," She told me. What she told me next dashed my hopes completely, and froze me in place.

"You've soiled your pants. He can smell you."

Spoiler

The lid of the box I was hiding in was thrown open, and I shrieked in terror for my life. It reached inside the box with its grubby, enormous hands, yanking me up and out of it. I kicked, I screamed, I writhed and twisted. He took my good arm, and bent it backwards- like he was playing with a doll, my arm popped out of my socket and I screeched from the unbearable pain. The dog head snapped and barked at me, biting into my shoulder, ripping chunks of flesh from me. I felt him put his hand on my head, and he twisted. I thought my skull would fracture, I thought my neck would explode. He twisted my head until I could no longer scream. He twisted, and twisted-

I awoke suddenly, gasping for breath and holding my chest. Intense pain wracked through me, radiating from my heart, and spreading across my chest and arms, down into my stomach. I felt I was going to be sick, doubled over sitting on my bed, unable even to scream as the air was caught in my lungs. I immediately rolled the upper half of my body to the side and vomited over the edge of the bed, but it was an empty dry heave, and only a strand of foamy spittle came out.

The pain began to subside, and I felt a cooling sensation running down my spine, originating in the base of my skull. It calmed me somewhat, and helped me to feel normal again. I was able to collect myself, swing my legs over the edge of the bed, and consult my surroundings. I was in a strange, sterile room- a cell, perhaps. The walls and the floor were all made of this same opaque white plastic, a bluish light radiating through it and lighting up my room with cold colors. The room was tiny- it was no wider than the length of my bed, and only about one and a half times that long. Just enough room so that I could stand up.

There was a mirror in the room. It ran from the floor, up to the ceiling- large enough for me to see my entire body. I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at myself. I was a woman. I had short, bob cut, scarlet red hair. My eyes were a shimmering shade of violet. My skin was light and pinkish, mottled only by freckles on my upper cheeks. I stared, and stared into the mirror, realizing that this was me.

Then, I realized that this wasn't me.

Then, I realized what had just happened.

"State your name," I heard her voice again. I hadn't looked at the name on the mirror yet. I was feeling my wrist, feeling my hand. Feeling my neck. I ran my hands up the side of my face, holding my cheeks. Then- I began to scream. I screamed, and I screamed, in a voice that wasn't my own. I writhed around like a possessed woman on the bed, kicking my feet, eyes bugging out of my head.

"WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME!!? WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME!!! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MEEEEE!!?" I howled, over and over again. I screamed for so long, that I eventually wore myself out, lying on my side in the bed, voice completely hoarse and dry.

"You are here for examination. The first test is very simple. You must tell me your name. Then..."

"You must proceed."

I'm very glad you're enjoying them. I am proud of that last one, and the world it's built in. Even though there's going to be a lot of layers of complexity, throughout the entire story we will actually learn very little about the world it all takes place in. I may write more stories in the future involving that world, but I don't have any plans as of yet. I enjoyed writing that last one a lot, though I wonder sometimes if there's something evil in me that compels me to create such a horrible scenario.

No updates right now, but I might do another chapter when I come home tonight. I may not, as I keep coming home from work and cranking these out from scratch in the 4-5 hours ish that I have before bed, and I'm sort of getting tired. But I also really enjoy it, so I might just.

I'd like to give everyone a break from the rough humiliation and the gory violence and circle back around, so I'll be doing the next chapter of Suramar Nights, which I recently realized I fucked up the title of in the title of this thread. I wonder if I can get that changed. Anyway, it's gonna be really nasty, but the tone will be far more light hearted.

*009*2021-05-21 07:13

Alright, so, I was planning on doing the second chapter of Suramar Nights but I just can't seem to get into it. The horny has passed, and I'm really interested in doing another chapter of the horrible death experiment story, so that's next up on the plate. I promise I'll write more horny stuff later on, probably in a month when the horny returns

*012*2021-06-01 01:18

Inspiration has struck me, so I'm gonna do another chapter. I dunno how long it'll be right now, we'll just see where it goes!

The following story will contain wetting, messing, S&M bondage, sexual themes, and outright sex. And maybe some other mushy stuff.

Her

(Chapter 1.2)

"Ah.. ahh... ah! Ohh! Mmmmnnnnh, please, oh please, oh don't stop, ooohhh!" A sharp smack resounded through the bedroom and I squealed with pleasure, my bottom stinging furiously from the firm spank Mistress gave me. "You don't tell me what to do!" She hissed sternly at me, reaching down and grabbing my hips. She squeezed them tightly, pulled me back onto her strap-on, filling and stretching me. I was getting absolutely railed on the bed, this morning. The acrid smell of urine filled my nostrils as my face rubbed against the wet spot on the bed I was being fucked in. Mistress leaned over me and grabbed the back of my head, pushing and rubbing my face around in it.

"Do you like that? Hmm? How does your own piss smell, slave?" She taunted me, as her hips rhythmically bucked back and forth, firmly pounding into me. I was orgasming for the second time already- whimpering and moaning while cum streaked down the inside of my thighs. My thighs trembled, my toes curled tightly. I gripped the bedsheets with both of my hands, burying my face in the mattress, despite the fact I was face-first in my own bedwetting accident.

It had happened again that morning. It had been starting to happen more often, without the help of drugs. I was in my own bed, this time. I stirred half-awake as I felt the familiar sensation of warm wetness pooling under my bottom. As I fully awakened, I realized what was happening, and the stream tapered off to a stop. But that didn't matter, because the bed was already quite wet. I lifted the sheets to look down at myself, seeing the puddle I had made, seeing my inner thighs wet with pee. "Ah... I wet the bed again..." I murmured to myself. "I... I'm a bedwetter. A naughty little bedwetter." Still, I was obsessed with the act, even though accidents had happened over and over again, now that I was Mistress's slave. Still I was obsessed with saying the words out loud- it made me feel light in the head, woozy almost, and it made me tingle between the thighs.

I started to wet again. I held the sheets up so I could watch, watch as my pee stream arced into the sheets between my legs. I spread my legs apart and pulled my labia up, watching rapt with attention as I saw my stream arc higher and higher, and then start hitting the top sheet. I peed against the top sheet for awhile, watching as the pee soaked across it, sprayed everywhere in the bed, rained down over my lap and lower belly... I dropped the sheet and relaxed my legs, fully releasing my bladder, and let the warm, wet sensation wash over me. A sense of relief flooded through me as my bladder emptied itself into the bed. A shaky breath of release came from me, as the last few drops came out. I slid my hand down my abdomen, and began to touch myself.

"And just what do you think you're doing?" I heard from the dark corner of my room, and I whimpered with fear, eyes darting back up. I hadn't seen her at all- it was as if she wasn't even there. She had blended seamlessly into the darkness- Mistress. Her gorgeous pink-maroon hair reflected in the bare amount of sunlight trickling through my bedroom curtains- Like me, she was naked from head to toe. "I- I'm-" I started to stammer, but her elegant long legs strode across the room in a couple of steps and she reached down, grabbing my wrist and pulling my hand away from my pussylips. "Don't even fucking bother, I saw everything. Who gave you permission to touch yourself?" She tilted her head and narrowed her glowing white eyes at me, getting right in my face. I whimpered, and my lower lip quivered, knowing I was in trouble. "Ugh, seriously? You pissed the bed and now you're fucking masturbating? You are such a disgusting, filthy, perverted little rat."

"Guess I'm going to have to teach you a lesson," Mistress growled sternly at me, ripping the bedsheets off of me. I squealed in dismay as I was swiftly put across her lap, and delivered a painful, harsh lesson with her palm on my bottom. Just like every spanking I got, I squirmed, I whimpered, I cried, and I peed more. One thing lead to another, and I suddenly found myself in this situation.

Getting forcefully, deeply, mercilessly fucked in my own pee puddle. She smacked my already red bottom again, just to hear me cry. "That's right, whimper. Beg. You nasty little whore, I want to hear you suffer!" Mistress laughed at me, mocked me, and all I could do was whimper and curl my toes and cum. I was in heaven- this was where I belonged, I knew this now. All the things I had done in my life, I deserved nothing more than to be her plaything. I deserved the harshest punishments- I deserved to be her little toilet slave.

I slumped forward, energy spent, shuddering as my climax began to subside. Mistress pushed me forward, shoving me off of the toy and onto the bed, to simply lie there on my side, cum dripping down the back of my thigh. She undid the buckle on her strap-on and brought it to her lips, blessing me with the sight of her tasting my cum. "Not too bad. Your new diet is working out for you, I think," she murmured as she reached down and pushed it into my mouth, twisting it around and forcing me to lick and suck it clean of my own juices, which I did happily. She pulled it out of my mouth with a wet little plop, a tendril of drool connecting it to my lower lip. In my light-headed, blissful, post-fucking state, I looked up to her with half-lidded eyes, and murmured, "I love you."

This was a mistake.

Mistresses eyes first widened with surprise, and then narrowed with irritation. "What did you just fucking say?" She asked me with a sneer of disgust on her face. I hadn't even really quite realized it myself, but when I did, my eyes opened back up and my face glowed bright red with a blush. "I- It was an accid-" I didn't manage to get the words out of my mouth before I was eating heel, Mistress stepping right on my face, pushing my head into the wet mattress. "Don't you ever say something like that to me again! Ever! There is no room for love in this relationship, do you understand? You are my plaything, and I am your punishment! Love? Hah! This is nothing more than revenge, you worthless little shit."

I could hardly breathe with my face being stomped in like this. I kicked my feet, I struggled and tried to break free, but she was too strong. "Mmfh- mmfhhmmm!" I tried to speak, voice muffled by her long elven foot, that I understood. "Don't... you dare... think that I have forgotten what kind of debt you owe me. What you've done. You had best pray you are able to keep me entertained, because once I grow bored of you, I'm going to kill you. Bitch." With that, she spat on me, and turned to walk away- but then she stopped, deciding that wasn't quite good enough.

She came back and stomped her foot on the mattress next to my head, reaching down and grabbing my thick, wavy black hair. "Nnghh!" I cried out in pain, reaching up to try and hold my head. It felt as if she were going to rip my hair right off my head. She shimmied her hips, getting into position, and before I knew it, a hot, wet stream of urine was hitting me in the face. I gasped and sputtered, eyes screwed shut as she urinated on me. "You are nothing more than my toilet whore. Don't you ever forget it, shit-pants. Ahhh.... that feels SO much better. How does it taste, hmm? Aren't you so happy that Mistress is gracing you with her piss?"

The sad thing is, I was. Even though it hurt, even though my love had been spurned and I was ashamed, I was happy. It was quite rare for Mistress to ever relieve herself on me. The mortifying shame, the degradation of being used as a toilet- I was starting to enjoy these emotions... starting to become sexually aroused by them.

Mistresses pee stream started to drop down, arcing onto my breasts instead of my face, gradually going down to a trickle that ran down the inside of her own muscled thigh. This didn't seem to bother her, oddly enough. "You're fucking banned from the toilet today, slave. Get dressed. No washing yourself either, you're going to stink of pee all day." She stormed back toward my bedroom door, ripping it open. "STAY in your room, until I say you can come out!" Mistress roared at me, as she violently slammed the door behind her. I flinched- Mistress rarely got this angry. She was angry all the time, yes, but she never took it out on me quite like this. I wondered what, exactly, I had done.

No, I knew what I had done, but... why did it make her so mad?

Awhile later, I had gotten dressed- since apparently I was banned from using the bathroom until Mistress allowed it, I decided to wear one of my older, more... 'yellow' stained cotton panties, and one of my special pairs of white pants Mistress got for me. I used an old shirt to dry the pee out of my hair the best that I could, but even if I sprayed a little perfume on it, the smell of urine hung on me. I was quickly growing used to it anyway- so, with a sigh, I opened up my closet to try and pick out a shirt to wear. Then I heard a pounding on the door.

I shyly slinked over to it and opened it just a crack, only to see that nobody was there- and then I heard another pounding. It was coming from the front door. We had a guest, but... Mistress said I was to stay in my room, so, I couldn't go answer the door. I glanced up and down the hallway, wondering if I should do it anyway- it might have been a customer, and we needed the money. I crept out of my room and down the hall, carefully looking out for Mistress, when I suddenly saw her cross the living room, so I ducked behind a basket of laundry. She didn't see me, but I could still see the look of irritation on her face.

"What do you want?" I heard her say from around the corner. I couldn't see who it was- they said something to her, it must have been a woman. They were too far away for me to make out their voice, so I scooted the laundry basket down the hall to see if I could get a little closer.

"...ara. That is you, right?" I heard her say. "Yes, speaking, what the hell do you want? I don't recall doing anything to warrant a visit from the sentinels." I gasped and held my hand over my mouth, backing firmly against the wall into my hiding spot. We were in foreign territory- at least, foreign territory for ME. I was more than just a foreigner, I was a member of a hostile species. If they stormed the place and came in here, they'd be fully within their rights to kill me on sight. I tried to still my breathing, as I perked up my long pointy ears to try to get a better listen.

"No, you haven't, this is an unofficial visit- I was sent by General Feyla. Your term of service has come to an end, but... the war against the Forsaken is endless. They fashion their reinforcements from our dead. You've seen the horrors they've committed-"

"Yes, firsthand, on Darkshore. Is that what this is about? I've only just gotten out and you're trying to pull me back in?"

"With all due respect..."

I flinched as I heard a loud crashing noise- presumably Mistress trying to slam the door, in her anger. "You can shove your fucking respect. I'm done out there, do you hear me? Unless you have an official summons, the next time you set foot on my property, I'll shoot you for tresspassing. Get. Out."

"Ma'am, I don't understand, you were one of our best rangers- Don't you take pause at what's happening over there? Those arsonists dare to continue to tread earth and you-"

"You don't think I hate them just as much as you do? As any of us do? I was THERE that day, you know. I saw it all happen. I saw those I cared for die, and I'm tired of it. I'm retired. I have a happy life here, and you or Feyla or even the fucking Night Warrior herself won't take that away from-"

"Oh yes, we're quite aware of the happy life you've got for yourself right here. You know, it's a little suspicious even- you sure you aren't keeping anything... illegal here, are you? We wouldn't want to have to come back-"

Suddenly, I heard the deafening crack of one of our rifles going off, and I winced and clapped both of my hands over my ears, scooting back firmly against the wall. I felt a warmth spread across my butt, and realized that I was scared into wetting my pants again. My bladder wasn't very full, so the wetness barely soaked my butt and made a little wet patch on the carpet, but it was enough for me to be shocked at how easily I lost bladder control. I've always been a measly little coward, but just hearing a gunshot?

I dry-swallowed, frowning at my situation, and went to go crawl back into my bedroom. "GET OFF MY PROPERTY, AND DON'T COME BACK WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL SUMMONS OR A WARRANT!" I heard Mistress howling, along with the sound of boots and armor shuffling and moving quickly away from the door. I crawled back into my room, pulling the door shut behind me. I crawled under the bed, dragging the top bedsheet with me, not caring that it was still wet with my pee, and wrapped myself in it- hiding and trembling under my bed. Mistress was so angry today... I thought today might be the day she... sent me off.

It was totally silent in the house. I listened to the clock ticking on the wall, tick, tock, back and forth. My butt felt wet and clammy, and I wanted to change, but I knew that I'd probably be yelled at. So I curled up under my pissy sheets, under the bed, and waited, shivering and staring into the dimness of the room. It felt like an eternity to me, but only about five minutes went by, before I heard footsteps falling in the hallway outside my room, and the door creak open. "Oh slave, It's time for- Slave? Where did you go?" She stepped further into the room. I could see her ankle trembling before she stamped her foot on the floor. "Fucks sake, I TOLD you not to leave your ROOM!" She yelled, and a whimper escaped me.

She must have heard, because Mistress knelt down, and I saw her glowing white eyes peek under the bed. "There you are. What on earth are you doing under there?" She said to me condescendingly, and reached in to grab the bedsheets I was wrapped up in and drag me out. I squealed and kicked, not wanting to leave my safe hiding place, but I couldn't resist Mistress, and she grabbed me by the wrist and hoisted me to my feet. I trembled and looked at my feet, twiddling my hands fingers together in front of my chest.

"I- I... h-heard a shot," I murmured, looking hopefully up at my goddess. Her lips were pursed in thought, and she looked down at me in judgement, before reaching up and running her hand through my hair. "And you were scared, hm?" She took my shoulder and spun me around, glancing down and clucking her tongue. "Mmhm, I see. Scared enough to wet yourself. Only just dressed, and you're already having accidents? Tsk, tsk." She reached down and patted my bottom, rubbing her hand over the wet patch. She gave my ass a squeeze, and turned me back around.

I was expecting punishment, but instead, she held both of my cheeks and kissed me on the forehead. "Such a dumb little pantswetting baby," She cooed to me, and I flushed and glanced away, too shy to look her directly in the eye. "Come on now. It's time for breakfast."

She lead my by the hand into the kitchen, and sat me down at the table, the same spot where I always sat and had my breakfast. There was a bowl of porridge on the table on the other side, where she normally sits, but nothing for me. "U-um... where's...?" I started to ask, looking expectantly up at my Mistress, my caretaker. "Where's yours? I have it right here," She said. Mistress took her chair and scooted it around the table, sitting it in front of me so that she could sit down, within arms reach, giving my bowl a little stir. "If you're going to wet your bed and poop your pants like a little baby, I'm going to treat you like one. Now, here comes Mama Raven, swooping down into her nest! Fwoooosh!" She even did the sound effects, zooming the spoon around and pushing it into my face.

I was horrifyingly embarrassed- I hadn't been treated like this before. I was a good slave, though, so I opened my mouth and let her feed me. It was humiliating... and my wet butt felt even more cold and clammy now that I was sitting on it. I squirmed awkwardly in my chair, and Mistress looked down at me with that wonderful expression- that amused, toothy smirk, looking down at me like I was garbage, like I was scum. My heart fluttered at the sight of it. I should be happy, I thought- Mistress is taking it upon herself to hand feed me.

She sat the bowl down and fed me another spoonful, smiling at me and tousling my hair with her other hand as I obediently chewed and swallowed. "Good slut," She said to me, cooing affectionately. She had a strange look in her eyes, one I had seen a few times before, but couldn't quite place- I didn't know what emotion it was, but she didn't seem... unhappy. She held the spoon in the air and continued to stare at me, her expression slowly souring, turning to one of irritation. "On second thought, I don't have time for this," She spat, dropping the spoon on the table, taking me by the back of the head, and forcing my face into the porridge bowl. She laughed at me as I raised my face out of it, looking dumbly confused, food on my nose and cheeks and forehead.

I went to wipe my face off with my sleeve, picking up the dropped spoon dejectedly, but Mistress smacked it out of my hand. "No," She sneered at me. "Eat it like that. Like the fucking dog you are," She commanded me. A shiver of self-pity ran down my spine, as I slowly lowered my face to the bowl, and attempted to eat without using my hands, getting more porridge all over my face and in my hair. "Hah! This is amazing," She mocked me as she reached across the table for her own breakfast, to eat it like a normal, respectable person... unlike me. She pushed my face up out of the bowl, and took it, standing up and walking over to the middle of the floor, where she sat it down. "Dogs don't eat at the table."

Confused and embarrassed, I looked up at her, and then back down at the bowl on the floor. "Not hungry?" She asked me with that clever smirk on her face, and I slinked out of my chair, slowly getting down on the floor on my hands and knees, to finish my breakfast. As I bent down, Mistress came up behind me, grabbing me by my ear and yanking my head back. "Ah!" I cried out with pain, as she hissed into my ear. "Don't you fucking dare wet yourself today. Do you understand? And you're still banned from the toilet. You'll hold it until I give you permission to go. If I see a single wet streak down your thigh, I'm going to whip your ass so fucking raw, you won't be able to sit for a week, piss pants." This, naturally, made me gush piss into my panties in terror, an uncontrollable little spurt, which soaked my groin and just barely dribbled down my thigh.

"Finish your damn breakfast," She said, letting go of my head and pushing my face back towards the bowl. I finished eating like that, while she sat in her chair and used me as a footrest, crossing her legs and resting her heels on the small of my back while she ate her own bowl of porridge.

Thankfully, she allowed me to wash my face in the sink after, while I was taking care of cleaning up the dishes. I felt her standing behind me, looking down over me, watching me work. I shivered- it was an uncomfortable feeling, having her standing over me and judging how good of a job I was doing. I started to scrub a little harder- I wanted to please Mistress, after all. "That's enough," She said, putting her hand on my shoulder. "Lets get to work for the day."

I nodded and sat the last dish on the shelf to dry. "O-okay..." I murmured, turning and going to head into my little workshop. Mistress tugged on my ear, directing me away. "Not that kind of work, you dumb slut. What do we do when we have a bedwetting, hmm?" She berated me, starting to pull me by the ear towards my bedroom. "Ow! W- we- we clean th- the sheets," I said, blushing that I had forgotten about it. "That's right. Honestly, you've wet the bed so many times now, how do you not understand this? You'll work in the workshop when I say it's time. Today, we're cleaning."

We? I turned my eyes to the side to look up to Mistress. Would she be cleaning with me? Anticipation rose in my throat, I felt hot in the face, butterflies fluttering in my stomach. Mistress never worked alongside me. We had our own separate workshops- she said that she didn't want my piss-reeking bottom to distract her, but I think that she mostly needed the focus, or she couldn't work. Mistress was perfect to me no matter what, but after these few months I'm starting to understand who she is, and the flaws she has. She changes her mind and her mood at the drop of a hat, and I'm sure she couldn't get anything done if I was there for her to play with.

I get to work. I pull the bedsheets off the bed, and bring them outside to put in the wash basin. Mistress draws water from the well, boiling a cauldron of it, and then pours it into the basin to start soaking away my urine. The water is too hot to work with, so next, it is time for the mattress. I'm far too weak to move it on my own, so she has to help me, dragging it along behind her and mocking me for my weak, noodle like arms. We take turns drawing water and pouring it over the mattress, to wash out the pee stain, and eventually tilt the mattress against the wall to dry. I spend the next hour scrubbing laundry with soap in the hot water- every time I think I am done, Mistress brings another pair of clothes, or another sheet, for me to clean. By the time I'm done, my arms are screaming with ache, and I have to sit on a bench and rest.

I feel the sun streaming through the trees landing on my face, warming my body. I can hear the chirping of birds, and the rustling of wind through the trees. I don't know where we live, as I am not learned in the maps of the Alliance, but I know it is somewhere nice. The air is clean, and the heat is temperate. We live alone, out in the woods. I'm used to it- I've been used to living by myself for a long time. But I don't live by myself anymore- I live with Mistress.

I love her. Even though I am afraid that she might snap and decide to kill me, given what I am responsible for, I still love her. I do not live in perpetual fear any longer. Nobody comes to throw rotten fruit at me, or to harass me and call me names. Mistress calls me names all day, of course, but I feel as if I deserve it. It is not a bad life, I think to myself, as I rest in the late morning sun. I am fed and protected, I sleep in a comfortable bed. I am warm and taken care of. I am protected... Mistress protects me. She's so strong... stronger than I could ever be. She wouldn't ever need something like the Black Words. Her arm and her sword, her gun is well enough.

As I take a break from work, so does she. I watch her, standing twenty paces from the house, down at her range. Levelling her rifle at a clay target hanging in a tree- she fires once, and the target shatters into a million pieces. I'm impressed. I've tried to shoot a gun before- we make them, after all, so I was curious as to how they worked. It's hard- very hard- they're heavy things, and aiming with them is difficult. The scopes we put on them help a great measure, but I still can't hit anything but the trees behind my target. Mistress is much more skilled than I.

Though I revere her for her talent, a curiosity gnaws at me. As she returns to the home with one of our hand-crafted rifles slung over her back, I ask- "Why do you use that?" And she stops, glancing down at me. Her eyes are piercing, and I feel like she wants me to explain further. "I-I mean... Why do we... why do we make these? You- you're Kaldorei, aren't you? Why do you use a gun, instead of a bow?"

She takes the weapon off her shoulders, looking down at it, running her fingers along it affectionately. I swallow back my jealousy, wishing she would touch me like that. "A bow is a bow," She explained. "A piece of wood with a string. Depending on the tensile strength of the string, the feathering and sleekness of the arrow, and the craftsmanship of the wood, a bow can be a powerful tool. We Kaldorei make the finest bows in Azeroth. Your people and your paltry bows are pathetic, compared to ours." I was used to insults about my species, so I grimaced and nodded, letting her continue.

"But, a rifle is a different thing. A bow can only be made so perfect. Our bows are near perfect creations, and they grow closer to that level of perfection every new generation of craftsmen we have. But a gun... I can tell, that this weapon- this weapon has centuries of refinement ahead of it. It is far more complex. The machinery that goes into it- the factors that improve the aim, stability, and stopping power of this weapon- the potential, compared to our bows, is nearly unlimited. I know that it is only a matter of time until these weapons become the norm- until these rifles outstrip the performance of our bows by miles. This weapon, slave-" She held it up, shaking it at me, to emphasize her point. "This weapon is the future. And I have a long, long future ahead of me, after all."

She then put her weapon down, but not before popping it open and removing the shell inside. That was one of the things she taught me, weapon safety- to never leave a rifle loaded, anywhere. As well as other things, like not pointing it at anything you wouldn't want to accidentally shoot. Pocketing the round in it, she stepped over to where I was sitting, looking down at me with stern, scornful eyes. "You, however-" She said, stomping her foot on the bench next to me. She grabbed me by the hair, and forced my face against her groin. "Who knows when your future might end? It might be a decade, it might be tomorrow. Your very life hangs on my whim, slave," She told me, grinding her hips against my face. "Yes Mistress," I said obediently, muffled by her crotch- she let me go, stepping off the bench, and grabbed my hand.

She took me inside, and we had sex again, for the second time that day.

Later, I was busy dusting the shelves in the workshop. I hadn't thought about it all day before, but a pressing need was at the forefront of my mind. It had only been a few hours, but I needed to relieve myself, badly. Whimpering, I held my hand firmly between my legs, continuing to clean with my other hand. I shouldn't have needed to go so soon, it didn't make sense- but I felt the pressure building in my bladder, and a telling gurgling in my stomach. Still, I was resolved to hold it. Mistress had commanded me, so I would hold it. I had to!

But, I was getting incredibly desperate. I kept having to stop my work, groaning and holding myself between the legs. I wouldn't pee, I couldn't... Mistress commanded me not to wet myself! My pants were finally dry again after all this time, I couldn't ruin them now... I had to sit the duster down and squeeze myself, doubling over at the waist, thighs clenched together and knees bent in desperation. "My oh my, does someone need the potty?" I heard a call from the entrance to the workshop- Mistress was leaning in the doorframe, watching me shamelessly hold myself like a little girl. I blushed brightly. "Y-...yes," I murmured with embarrassment, unable to meet her gaze. "Very well then," she said with a mischievous smirk. "You may use the bathroom. That is, if you can get in."

She followed me as I hobbled and potty-danced my way over to our home's singular bathroom. Still holding myself between the legs, I looked up in astonishment at what had become of our bathroom door. It looked like a safe, or something- it was made completely out of metal, and covered with locks and puzzles and all sorts of things. "Wh- what is this? When did you have it installed?" I asked. "When you were sleeping," Mistress said, reaching over and handing me a keyring. "Here's the keys. Best get to solving it, hmm? Remember, if you have an accident, I'm going to whip you raw."

I stared down at the keys in my hand, and then back at the complex lock on the door, momentarily forgetting my desperation. I understood very quickly that this was a challenge Mistress expected me to fail. It stung my pride, what little I had left of it- My mind was my last sanctuary, my bastion. I was weak, cowardly, pathetic, but I always considered myself to be clever. All these years of working with tools and gadgets- I should be able to solve something like this! A pang of desperation wracked me, and I moaned and held myself between the legs, whimpering and looking at the door. I would have to solve it- that's all there was to it. I feared the whipping I was promised, so I held on tightly, refusing to wet, and set about solving the door.

The first puzzle on the door was a sliding picture puzzle. Simple enough to solve, given enough time, but the amount of time I had was determined by the strength of my bladder. Holding it was becoming painful, I was so desperate. I slid the panels quickly, making more mistakes than I should have because of how badly I needed to go. As all the pictures lined up in place, I blushed with embarrassment, realizing that the completed picture was of me, quivering and wetting my pants. I remembered that incident- Mistress had taken a picture of it. I never imagined that this would be what she used it for. Next was a number puzzle- a series of switches that I needed to pick that added up to a certain total. This one was a little more complex, but not beyond me- the pressure in my bladder and the rumbling in my gut made it harder than it should have been.

I fumbled with the keyring I had been given, a spurt of pee escaping into my panties. I clenched my thighs tightly, willing myself to hold on. A little trickle started to flow from me, but I cut it off quickly- I could feel two hot, wet crescents form under my ass cheeks. One by one, I figured out which key went to which lock, based on their size and shape. Out of the seven keys on the ring, I used six for this part. From the look of it, there was only one more puzzle to solve- a sequence of gears. I stared befuddled at the challenge before me, not sure how it worked- turning the gears randomly, trying to see if I could figure it out based on the shape or noise that they made.

Eventually I realized that they all needed to be turned and locked together in a specific pattern, as the desperation to relieve myself wracked me. Mistress was watching over me the whole time, her lips pulled back into a vicious cheshire grin, glancing down at my bottom. "Tsk tsk," She chided me. "Are you leaking? It looks like you're a little wet. Didn't I tell you not to have an accident? It's as if you want me to whip you." She reached down and started to feel my bottom, grabbing and squeezing one of my asscheeks, and I whimpered and clenched my thighs together. The need to go was overwhelming, getting worse now that I knew I was so close to opening the door.

My stomach gurgled, and a sharp pang of desperation hit me, and I cried out, bending my knees and holding myself between the legs. I thought I was going to lose it, but instead, a noisy PRRAAAPPTT escaped me, and the blush on my cheeks grew even brighter. I uncontrollably farted. My eyes were wide and my mouth hung open, trembling as I tried to right myself.

"Ah!" I cried out, and another noisy FRRRRTT! came from my backside, as I dipped my bottom down. I was utterly humiliated- I shouldn't have been, given that I wet and pooped my pants on a daily basis, but I had never farted in front of Mistress before. The stink made my eyes water, and Mistress laughed at me. "Ahahahaha! Ugh, what a nasty little whore you are! Are you about to shit yourself, huh? Passing gas like that... pee-yew, that stinks!" She mocked me by pinching her nostrils shut and waving her hand to disperse the smell. "N-no, no, I--" I stammered to try to make an excuse for myself, but I only just ended up farting again. FRRRRPPTTT!!

My knees were quaking and knocking together, my toes curling and uncurling in my shoes, but I was still able to hold on, and focus on the challenge. I turned each gear as I thought they should fit together, shifting and moving them into place. Finally, I thought that I had it- so I inserted the final key into the lock, and tried to turn it. But, it wouldn't go. I must not have solved it correctly- I frantically looked back at the puzzle, trying to twist and alter the gears into what might be the correct configuration.

My face was hot with a blush of urgency, eyes squinted and lips pursed as I held on desperately, not understanding why it didn't work. Mistress didn't make it any easier, either- her hand kept caressing my butt, squeezing and patting my asscheek. Her other hand slid up my belly, to the collar of my shirt, starting to unbutton it. Her hand went into my shirt, fingers firmly tracing across my breast, starting to squeeze and grope me, pinching my tit between her thumb and forefinger. "Oh slave, you're so close, you aren't going to fail here, are you?"

I couldn't stop clenching my thighs together, I was so utterly desperate. I kept trying different combinations, but no matter what I did, the key wouldn't turn. A whimper escaped me, and I frantically kept trying to turn the key, as if somehow it would unlock. My mind wasn't working anymore- I was overwhelmed by my need to relieve myself. "A-ah...!" I suddenly felt hot, wet warmth spreading across my crotch, and soaking down the back of my legs. I couldn't hold it anymore- I was wetting my pants. My thighs quaked and I tried desperately to hold on, emotions running wild inside my head. The sensation was electric- relief growing as the wet patch soaked further and further down the back of my thighs. Tingling, blissful pleasure at Mistresses touch, the way she cupped and squeezed my breast, rubbed and groped my bottom as I peed my pants.

I couldn't hold it in anymore, and I farted- at least, I thought it was a fart, but it wasn't. Hot, messy filth burst into my panties, a small mound in the seat of my white pants that quickly started to stain brown. I remember that I was crying at this point- I felt so ashamed, even though this had happened time and time again. I couldn't do it, I wasn't smart enough to solve the puzzle. It was like Mistress always told me, I was just a stupid, pants-wetting, incontinent slut. I realized at this point that I had never done this before- I had never held my pee until I uncontrollably wet myself. All those times where I would get too distracted with my work and not realize I had to pee, and ended up wetting myself- I had just given up, been unwilling to deal with the pain of a full bladder. I realized now that I had been wetting myself on purpose for a long time, and this was the first time I truly, truly lost control.

"Aww... looks like my adorable little slave is having an accident in her pants!~" Mistress taunted me, smacking me on the bottom as I peed. I soaked my pants all the way down to my socks, before I managed to regain control. I'm not sure why I was so insistent on trying to hold it, at this point- I had utterly pissed myself, a solid wet patch going all the way down the insides of my thighs and the back of my legs, a tidemark rising up my butt, a diamond of wetness across the front of my lap, still hot, wet, glistening in the afternoon sunlight. My eyes were red from crying, my mascara streaked all down my cheeks- I was a mess, a filthy, pathetic little elf who had wet her pants.

I watched, whimpering and sniffling back tears, as Mistress reached past my shoulder, and put all the gears into place. It was the first combination that I had tried- I looked on in confusion as she reached for the key... and twisted it the other direction, counter-clockwise. That was it- that was the mistake I had made. I couldn't believe how stupid I was, swallowing back my tears as I watched Mistress push the door open. There it was, the toilet- I was standing not two paces away from it, and I had an accident. My stomach churned, and I realized that I wasn't done yet, so I rushed into the bathroom, but Mistress stopped me.

She snatched my wrist, forcing me to turn around, and look at her. I expected to see that scornful, amused, cruel look on her face, but she looked different for some reason. She was smiling... even her eyes smiled with her, looking at me like I was precious. I opened my mouth and stammered dumbly, not even able to form a coherent word, and she pulled me up against her body. Chest to chest, face to face, she held me against her. She tilted her head down, and she kissed me. She was kissing me... deeply, passionately, something she almost never did. Our tongues writhed together, her hand running up my back and shoulders. My knees shook again, and I suddenly started to leak, a dribble of urine that picked up into a full force pants wetting. I could feel my pee welling up in the narrow space between the gusset of my panties and the crotch of my pants, gushing down the inside of my legs.

There was a cold sweat on my brow, as I clenched and unclenched my asscheeks, fighting the growing urge as best as I could, my eyes squinted shut into this wonderful, blissful kiss. I put my hands on Mistress's shoulders, holding onto her like I might fall if I didn't. The moment I did that, I lost control of my bowels, and pooped my pants, with a filthy, noisy ppprrbblhhttt! It all came rushing out of me, a hot, sticky, filthy mess filling the seat of my pants. They stretched and tented to accommodate the growing load. Mistress rubbed my bottom and cupped her hand, feeling the growing mound of shit in my panties. I moaned into our kiss, legs trembling, as I full force, completely pissed and shit my pants. It was incredible- I had never felt a sensation like this, to be so incredibly desperate and then to suddenly feel this blissful relief. Hot pee spreading across my lap, hot, messy poop filling my pants- I thought I might climax then and there.

Mistress rubbed and patted the enormous bulge of filth in my pants. I had never pooped this much in my life- there was no way that this was natural, Mistress must have done something to me. Something in my morning porridge, maybe. Either way, the seat of my pants sagged, completely stained brown, so full of poop my waistband was pulled away from the small of my back. My pee stream tapered off as my bladder fully emptied, standing in a big yellow puddle, and I completely relieved my bowels. I was trembling, tears still leaking out of my eyes, as Mistress pulled away and looked down at me again- that expression of adoration quickly turning into her usual, condescending, amused smirk. I whimpered and shrank back, feeling small under her gaze.

"Look at you," she taunted me. "What did you do?" I swallowed and attempted to stop my helpless blubbering, using my sleeve to wipe at the tears running down my cheek. "I- I had an accident," I muttered ashamedly. "That's right. RIGHT in front of the toilet. Right in my arms, you had a huge accident." The fanatic obsession returned to me, as I became circularly trapped in my own head about it. "I- I wet-- I w-wet my pants... I peed... I soaked and soiled my pants... I pooped myself... used my pants as a toilet... crapped my panties..." I kept muttering to myself, not even noticing as Mistress put her hands on my shoulders, and pushed me down onto my knees. She unbuttoned her fly, pushing her pants and panties down to the floor, not seeming to care that they were getting in my pee puddle.

She pulled on her labia with two fingers, and started to urinate on me. She aimed her pee stream so that it arced into my lap. I could feel her hot wetness soak into my pants and drip down between my legs, flood all across my engorged, tingling pussylips. She arced her stream up and down, so that one moment she was peeing on my lap, the next she was peeing on my breasts. Mistress rolled her head back, draping her beautiful maroon hair down her shoulders. "Ahhhh... that's so much better. Mmm, I needed to use you for awhile... I think I might just have this toilet uninstalled. You can just pee and poop your pants, and I'll piss on you."

My eyes lit up instantly. I hadn't realized how far my depravity had fallen, that I was so excited for this. "Yes Mistress! Yes, please! Please pee on me!" I cried out, reaching up and starting to unbutton my shirt, so that she could urinate on my bare chest. "Oh, you like that, hmm? Do you love Mistress's piss?" She scoffed at me, smirking and laughing at my degeneracy. I blushed furiously, and nodded, making my own pissy bed and laying in it. "Y-yes Mistress, I love your piss," I murmured. It reeked so badly in this room, I thought I was going to choke... the smell of hot, freshly peed in pants, my shirt soaked with Mistress's pee, my pants filled to the brim with poop. I realized then that even though it stank, I enjoyed it- I enjoyed the smell of being forced to kneel in my own accident.

Mistress snatched me by the hair, yanking my face towards her pussy. She forced my head against her groin, and continued to urinate into my mouth. "Drink," She commanded me, just like the first day we had met. Except this time, I was all too willing to drink- I gladly lapped it up, eyes closed, scooting closer on my knees, my enormously poopy pants waddling back and forth from the action. "Oooohhh... yes... mmm, yes... lick," She commanded me, and I licked. Urine ran all over my chin and dripped down onto my chest, as I pleasured Mistress while she peed. She was peeing quite a lot... perhaps even more than I had wet myself. And she remained totally composed the whole time- it ashamed me, made me feel more pathetic, that I had totally lost bladder control and Mistress was holding more pee than me, calm and self-assured.

I slid my hands up the back of Mistress's thighs, to hold onto her while I orally pleasured her. Her pee stream tapered off, and in a matter of seconds, I was licking and lapping up cum instead of urine. Greedily squeezing the back of her toned, muscled thighs, while I messily swirled my tongue inside of her. Before I met Mistress, I didn't even know I was a lesbian- now, I adore every chance I get to lick her pussy. It was like a gift, a blessing that this powerful, indomitable woman would allow me to even touch her, let alone give her an orgasm, which I was very intent on. I'm proud to say that in the three months I've met Mistress, I've given her an orgasm at least four times a week. Well, I should be proud, but that's nothing compared to her- I climax multiple times a day because of her.

"Mmmm, yes... oh, you naughty, filthy little slut, yes, just like that... mmmnnn, look at you, kneeling in your own piss puddle, pants full of shit, you dirty, incontinent little whore..." I could tell she was getting into it. Mistress had her own sense of oral fixation- whenever she was getting close, she insulted and cursed at me more and more. My stomach suddenly churned again, and I felt that urge- I didn't even bother attempting to resist it. I popped my bottom out, and shamelessly shit my pants with a frraappphht! I couldn't believe it, it was so much- I had pooped my pants so much, it was actually forcing its way down the back of my soaking wet thighs, my waistband pulled two inches from my back. Mistress gasped and bucked her hips, gripping my hair tightly and writhing her hips against my face. "Oooohh! Oh yes! Oh you dirty bitch! Mmmnnn, yes, oh yes, oh you fucking worthless pants-messing whore! Ah, ah-- ahh!!~"

One messy, gushing orgasm later, Mistress was dragging me by the ear back to her room. She pulled open her drawer of punishment devices, and pulled out the locking belt- I held my hands up and out of her way as she yanked it through my belt loops and pulled it tight, locking it. The gap in my waistband was gone now, and I was locked into these bulging, soaked, shit filled pants. I would be staying in them as long as Mistress wanted- which also meant that I would be wetting my pants every time I needed to pee. Mistress tore off my shirt, leaving me topless, my pale pink breasts bouncing free. That was one thing that I had... Mistress had good breasts, but mine were a bit larger. This apparently pleased her, though, because she never missed a chance to fondle my boobs. She was doing it now, looking me over, cupping one of my breasts and patting the mound in my pants with the other. "Goddess, you really shit your pants, huh?"

I wanted to deny it, or say something to try and defend myself, but when I opened my mouth, the only words that came out were "I love you". Mistress glared down at me, expression quickly turned sour, and smacked me across the head. She had hurt and punished me a lot, but for some reason, that smack felt more real than the others, and I wanted to cry, whimpering and backing down. "Would you stop fucking doing that!?" She yelled at me. With a sneer of disgust, she grabbed my wrist, turned me around, and shoved me against the wall, forcing my wrists into the restraints and locking them there. This was the same wall where Mistress's draenei 'friend' had pooped herself in terror at being whipped. Which meant that for me...

"N- no, no please- no Mistress, please, please--" I begged her, pulling on the restraints, wetting my pants in terror, bladder having already begun to fill again. I felt the hot wetness run along my crotch and splatter on the floor, dripping off the huge mound of poop in my pants. "Shut the fuck up, you degenerate slut! What did I tell you before, hmm? That you'd get a whipping if you peed your pants! And what did you do?" I tugged harder trying to escape the restraints as a terrified sob came from me. "I wet my pants! I did! I wet myself and pooped my pants! Please Mistress, please!" I cried out in agony as I felt the first harsh smack across my back. Only... it wasn't as bad as I thought. She wasn't using her regular whip, this was a nine-tailed whip. It was painful, yes, but not nearly as painful as I expected. I kind of felt... good.

"Ahh!" I screamed as she whipped me again. And again, and again... the small of my back was glowing pink from the continued whipping. She paused for long enough to come up behind me, slide her hand up my stomach and grope my breast, leaning in and licking my cheek. "Does that hurt, slave? Hmm? Wetting your pants again? Gonna cry, like a little baby bitch?" She taunted me, tilting her head up and biting my ear. She didn't break the skin, but it certainly hurt, and I screwed my eyes shut and whimpered, feeling my bladder spasm and gush what little had filled it into my pants once again. Then, the whipping continued. Gradually, I became used to the tingling sensation of pain. Degraded, helpless, tortured... my hot, pissy pussy tingled with the need for attention.

As if reading my mind, at this point, Mistress paused her punishment and undid my locking belt, just for long enough to nestle a little egg vibrator up against my clitoris. Re-locking the belt again, she dialed it on to a low setting with the remote, and resumed whipping me. The more she whipped me, the higher the setting went- pleasure, pain, pleasure, pain- It was so much, combined with all my other emotions, I was beginning to forget which was which, and associate the two together. Mistress paused, dialing the setting up, and took my cheek, forcing my head to turn. She kissed me again- that same hungry, deep, passionate kiss from before- as my legs shook and my toes curled, I was oozing cum into my panties, practically frothing at the mouth.

Then, it came. I had been hoping it wouldn't, but it did. The whip- her real whip. Searing hot pain shot across my back and I screamed- literally shrieked in agony- and had an incredible, overwhelming orgasm. I was so worn out I just hung against the wall, limp, held up only by the restraints. Mistress dialed the vibrating toy down to 'off', returned her tools to the drawer and let me go, and I immediately fell- but she caught me. I was wobbly on my feet, as she helped me, step by little step over to her bed. She laid me down on it, on my side- so that I wouldn't get my poopy butt on her sheets- and laid next to me. She pulled me into her arms, cuddling me affectionately. She tilted my chin back, and kissed me.

We laid together like that for at least fifteen minutes, but it felt like an eternity of heaven for me. I couldn't even smell my dirty pants anymore. She kissed me, over and over. She rubbed my sore back and patted my messy bottom. She slid her leg between my thighs. It was as if all my dreams were coming true this day. Her kisses had been rare before, but now I was getting all of them. Tender and sweet, sloppy and lusty, all kinds of kisses- we made out the entire time, as I caught my breath.

"Now it's time for work," She told me and patted my butt again as she helped me up off the bed, and directed me to my workshop, where I make my gears and interlocking bolts. I knew what was coming, it had happened before, but I still couldn't quite get used to it- I grimaced as she made me sit on my work bench, sit right in my poopy mess, smear it all over my butt and fill my ass crack and smoosh down my thighs. She locked my ankles into place, dusted her hands off, and left me to my work. I did what I could, but work was coming slowly, because I couldn't get over the stink filling my nostrils and the uncomfortable sensation of sitting in pants absolutely bulging with poop. Not to mention, every once in awhile, Mistress randomly turned on the remote egg vibrator, interrupting my work and making me bend double over the table.

A short while later, she returned, wearing pants once again. "Am- am I done?" I asked, twisting my body to look up at her, but she didn't say anything. All she did was come over to me, and unbutton her pants. She dropped them around her ankles, stepping out of them, and she put her foot up on the bench next to me. She pulled her labia back, and proceeded to pee on me, again. For the third time today, she was peeing on me... piss splattered all over my chest, ran down into my pants and warmly soaked them once again. I shuddered with delight, and in response, Mistress thumbed the switch and turned on my vibrator. I moaned whorishly, squeezing my thighs together. About a minute later, she was finished, and without a word, she put her pants back on, and left.

About two hours later, my bladder was full, so I wet my pants. There was nothing I could do about it. What surprised me was how easily it happened- usually when I wet myself Mistress forces me, or I have to try a little. But this time, I soaked my pants like I was sitting on the toilet, without any effort. My urine poured over the edges of the bench, splattering and making a puddle underneath me. "Mmmmmnnn..." I moaned tenderly at the relief and warmth. I felt a hand caress my hair, and looked up- Mistress was there. I hadn't heard her come in- she just came and went wherever she wanted, silent as a ghost. She leaned down and kissed my cheek. "Good girl," She said to me. Her breath smelled of wine... that worried me a bit. I'd never seen her intoxicated before.

Just like the last time, she unbuttoned her pants, dropped them, put her leg up on the bench, and pissed on me. I was getting used to it now, so it didn't even interrupt my work- Mistress casually just using me as a toilet while I carved out grooves and ground stones into dust. She tousled my hair affectionately as her stream tapered off, and she pulled her pants back up, and left me to my work. This continued to happen throughout the night. It was wonderful- Mistress peeing on me so much. I hadn't realized how much I enjoyed it, before. She was starting to come in and pee on me more frequently- I wet myself every few hours. Each time Mistress came in, she seemed increasingly more intoxicated.

It was growing close to the evening, and Mistress hadn't come in to pee on me in awhile. I was a bit concerned, given how she had been drinking, so I wanted to go check on her. Locking me into my bench was more of a formality, really, because with all my tools in front of me, it was simple to simply take the leg restraints apart and free myself. So, I did, standing up and shuddering as the weight of my poopy pants fell away from my bottom. Ffffsssshhhhhhhhhhh... I heard the tell-tale sound of pee hissing against already wet fabric coming from me, looking down in surprise. Urine re-soaked my white jeans, gushed across my lap, ran down the back of my thighs, dripped off my messy bulging pants. "I- I'm peeing..." I murmured to myself in surprise- I had grown so used to using my pants as a toilet that I just started to pee, without even noticing I had to go.

I stood there for half a minute, holding my hand against my groin and re-wetting my pants. The floor of my workshop was soaked with pee puddles- though I did work with fluids often, so there was a drainage hole in the middle of the shop. Later on I would have to come in and rinse everything down. I wet myself quite a bit when I craft parts for Mistress's rifles, so I was used to the routine. As the last drops of pee gushed into my pants, I started to move and make my way into the house, to check on Mistress.

I was rightfully worried about her. She didn't seem to be hurt, but she also didn't seem to be in any kind of state to help herself. I found her heavily intoxicated, sitting in her favorite chair, head rolled back and snoring. I giggled a little bit- it was cute, not to mention, Mistress didn't usually snore. Sleeping like that would clearly strain her neck, so I came over and touched her thigh, giving her knee a little shake. "Mistress... Mistress, are you okay?" I asked her in a tender, quiet voice, as not to startle her. She groaned and rolled her head forward, almost falling off the chair- I caught her before she could fall forward. "Whas... uhh... huh? Wha're you doin baby? Uughhh... baby... heh, you're such a baby... little piss pants." Of course- even intoxicated out of her mind, she wouldn't stop insulting me.

"Y... yes Mistress, I wet my pants."

"You stink," she mocked me, laughing at me and slouching back into her chair. "Y-yes, yes Mistress, I stink. How much did you...?" I asked, before I looked down at the ground, seeing two and a half empty bottles of wine. I raised my eyebrows, shocked that I was even able to wake her up after that much. "Why did you drink so much, Mistress?" I asked her, concern tinging my voice. "I hah... ta think... 'bout summnh..." She waved her hand at me to dismiss me, try and shoo me away, but I just came back and caught her shoulders. "Well... um... maybe you should get to bed," I suggested, and she nodded her head in agreement. "Can you walk?" I asked her. She planted her feet firmly on the ground, pushed on the arms of her chair, and tried to stand up- only to fall back down into the chair. "Uhhhh... no."

Grimacing, I took Mistress's hand and helped her up the best I could. She was a tall, muscular woman, which made her considerably heavier than me. She could pick me up and carry me over her shoulder- something she had literally done before- but I couldn't budge her at all by myself. Luckily, she was coherent enough to lean on me, and we gradually made our way down the hallway to her bedroom, holding her arm across my shoulders and letting her use me as a crutch. We were halfway there, when I heard that sound again. That unmistakable hhhhsssssssshhhhhhh... I looked down at my lap, shocked. How could I possibly be wetting myself again, already? There was no way!

But, I didn't see anything. No glistening spreading across my lap, no rivulets dripping between my legs. It couldn't be... I looked over to my left. I wasn't wetting myself.

It was Mistress. Mistress was wetting her pants.

She had gotten so intoxicated, she was wetting herself, soaking her dark violet pants. I watched in astonishment as glistening wetness soaked down the inside of her thighs, pee streams falling between her legs like little waterfalls. The hissing noise of her peeing combined with the splattering sound of pee puddling on the wooden floor. It was a full on, complete accident, and I watched rapt with attention as Mistress pissed her pants for a full minute straight. It was... incredible. It felt like the first time Mistress made ME wet my pants, I was unbelievably turned on. I hadn't ever realized that I wanted to see this, but I did. "M... Mistress... you... um... you're... wetting yourself."

She looked down at her lap as if only just now realizing, putting her hand against her crotch. "Uuughh... fuck," She murmured. I couldn't tell if she was blushing, or if her face was just red from drinking. "Now I'm a piss-pants like you, too." I shook my head and continued to help Mistress along, diverting her instead to the washroom, praying that she hadn't re-locked that ridiculously difficult puzzle door. "N-no, I... you... um, you have an excuse... it was an accident... I- I'm much worse than you, I pee my pants every day. Look, I pooped my pants, remember? I'm- s-still wearing them." She looked down at me and smirked, eyes half-lidded with exhaustion and intoxication. "Oh yeah... hah, you did... mmmnn..." She let go of my shoulders and reached down to pat my bottom, firmly pressing on my dirty pants, squishing it against my butt, and I grimaced again. "Look at you... sexy little shit-pants slut..."

"L-lets not get distracted," I tried to coax her, reigning her in and taking her arm again to lead her to the bathroom. I helped her to strip down first, and got her into the tub, where I started to fill it with hot bathwater. Meanwhile, I had to trudge my poopy ass through the house to Mistress's room, to get the key for my belt. When I came back, she had draped her arms alongside the tub and was moaning at the feeling of hot water starting to wash over her legs, rolling her head back. "Mmmnn, tha's good," She muttered to herself.

I, on the other hand, had to use my own... special 'potty station'. It wasn't like a bath tub- It was kind of like a shower, but with a hose that had a narrow nozzle. A firm stream came from it that I would use to wash myself down in my little glass and porcelain chamber, watching as my mess went down the large drain, glad to finally be free of the oppressive, messy, soaking wet pants. I rinsed out my pants the best that I could, and left them to hang on a hook in the chamber. I blushed at the sight of them, the pure white fabric totally stained brown and yellow. We'd have to bleach them, again...

I sighed, and turned to leave Mistress to her bath, when she reached out and snatched my wrist. "Come in with me," She told me. Sharing a bath with Mistress... I blushed with shyness. I'd never done it before, and the idea definitely pleased me. "If... if you want," I murmured, and gingerly came over, stepping into the bath tub. It was big enough for the both of us, and I was able to sit between Mistress's ankles, sighing happily as I felt the hot water rise around my butt, a welcome change from hot pee soaking my butt. Mistress snatched up my foot, picking it up and starting to rub and squeeze it, like it was a toy for her to play with. "Mmmn... your feet aren't so bad," She thought aloud as she examined them. "Th... thank you," I blushed at the compliment. "I like feet too, you know... on top of... the other stuff," She said, sounding just a little more coherent.

"The... other stuff..." I parroted back at her, shifting uncomfortably on my butt. We had never explicitly talked about it- our interests, what pleased us. I had figured out by now that Mistress likes to punish me and make me wet myself, obviously, but I wasn't sure what else there was- and I was completely unsure of what pleased ME. This was all new territory for me. "I um... I would like it... if you made me um, wear... um..." She pinched her fingers against my foot, starting to rub her thumb along the bridge of it, massaging it. "Go on, say it."

"Um... wear... diapers." She chuckled at me, raising her eyebrows. "More diapers, huh? Ok. Then you're going to have to go buy them." My face went bright red with embarrassment. "M-me!?" I said, and she laughed at me again. "Oh, are you too shy? How do you think I feel going out and buying adult diapers for women? People think they're for me, sometimes."

That made me blush even brighter, as I remembered what had happened, out in the hallway. I twiddled my fingers together as the water rose up to my hips, staring down between my legs. "About... about that..." I murmured. "Oh?" Mistress asked, again raising her eyebrow. I was worried- she was being uncharacteristically calm with me. Usually, that meant a mood swing was right around the corner. If I made her mad... But I still wanted to say it. "I... liked it..."

"What did you like?" She asked, putting my one foot down and starting to massage the other. "When you, um... when you... peed."

"I peed a lot today," She said with a shrug, and I shook my head. "No, I mean... when you... in the hallway..."

Mistress narrowed her eyes sharply at me, holding my foot still. I trembled under the might of her gaze. Even intoxicated like this, I'm sure I would never be any kind of match for her. I thought she was going to punish me, when her face broke into a smirk, and she started to laugh. "Really? I see!" She said, still laughing at me. I chuckled along nervously, glad that I had apparently amused her instead of incurring her wrath. She braced her feet and arms against the tub, and lifted her hips out of the water- and peed, gushing an arc of urine onto my chest. "Don't forget your place, slut," She warned me good naturedly. But I was feeling rebellious today... I decided it was my turn. I lifted my own hips out of the water, pursed my lips and gave a push... and peed on Mistress.

She stared at me again with that furious expression, but ended up sputtering and laughing at me. "Oh, is that revenge for all the times today?" She asked me. I blushed and nodded, and she answered me by peeing a spurt on me again. So, I peed on her, again. We did that back and forth with what little remained in our bladders, giggling at each other. I was so happy- it felt like I was really trying to connect with her. It was a shame that she had to be drunk for it to happen, but still... I was happy. She helped me wash my back and I helped her with hers. By the time we were done she was just slightly sobered up enough to walk on her own, towling off her hair. She tossed it into the hallway laundry basket and stumbled into bed. I managed to get her to roll over enough to tuck her blanket up over her shoulders.

She was so strong, but in this moment, she looked so tender to me. I had never seen this side of her. I bent down, to kiss her on the cheek. She had punished me two times already for this, but I couldn't help it- I felt so strongly about it, that I just had to say it again. "I love you," I murmured to her. To my surprise, she just rolled over and groaned tiredly, and replied "You, too." I stared down at her and my heart soared in my chest. I felt like a little girl having her first crush again. I was too shy and awkward to stay, so I left her like that, blowing out the candles and retreating to my own room, dressing in my silky pink pajamas and getting into bed. I was so giddy, full of adrenaline, and it took me nearly an hour to get to sleep.

The next morning, I awoke to the sunlight streaming through my curtains, the birds chirping, wind gently rustling through the trees outside my window. I awoke to a dry bed, for once, and stretched and yawned, pulling the sheets off and rolling out of bed. Since I didn't wet the bed, I had to pee, and needed to brush my teeth anyway, so I headed straight out the door and down the hallway to the bathroom- when suddenly, something was clicked around my neck. Mistress had stalked up behind me, like usual, and had put a collar on me- she walked around in front of me with a smirk, tugging on the leash to make me follow her. My heart pounded with anxiety- had she remembered what happened last night? Was she going to punish me for it?

She made me walk with her out into the living room. She cupped my cheek, giving me a few light smacks, more affectionate than painful. "Sit," she commanded me, and I immediately obeyed, getting down on my knees on the floor and looking up at her. She was wearing one of her favorite outfits- tight, form fitting light blue pants and a black and blue corset-like top that had no sleeves and pushed up her chest, giving her a curvier form. She caressed my face, tousled my hair, and turned around, backing herself up to me. She yanked on the leash to force my face against her butt...

And she started to pee.

Warm urine cascaded over my face and dripped down onto my chest, soaking into my pink silky shirt, and I watched, utterly astounded as the wet patch glistened and spread across Mistress's butt, down the back of her thighs... totally soaking her pants. She was doing it again, Mistress was wetting herself- right in front of me, right in my face. She tugged harder on the leash to force my face against her toned backside. "Ugh, what a disgusting feeling. Is this what you really do every single day? And you like this, hmm? Does the perverted little slave enjoy watching Mistress piss her pants?"

"Mmmfff!" I tried to reply, muffled by her butt and her soaking wet pants, the taste of her pee on my lips, the acrid scent of urinated in pants hitting my nostrils. I had come to enjoy this smell, but it was even more incredible knowing that it was Mistress doing it. She wiggled her butt back against my face, as I felt the pee stream running down the back of her legs begin to taper and cut off. "It's so warm and wet, isn't it? Do you like it? Are you aroused, you horny little slug?" She let go of the leash and allowed me to back off, to get a full look at it. At Mistress's shapely bottom and strong thighs, soaking wet with pee. Mistress... Mistress wet herself... for me. She had remembered what I said last night... and instead of being punished, I was being rewarded.

"Up," She commanded, tugging on the leash and dragging me up to my feet. My hand shook, and I felt overcome with a desire. "You may touch it," Mistress said, once again reading my mind. I ran my hand up and down her inner thigh, caressed her bottom, in awe of what a wonderful sensation it was, touching her wet ass. She turned around and took my hand, pulling me up against her, chest to chest and face to face. Her other hand went down to my bottom, giving it a smack. "Your turn," She commanded me. "Piss yourself."

I was happy to oblige, the floodgates opening up as I willingly peed a steady stream in my silky pink pajamas. They clung wetly to my inner thighs, I felt that wonderful warmth, the rush and the embarrassment of having an accident in front of Mistress. My pee soaked under my butt cheeks, drenched down the inside of my legs and the back of my thighs. I shivered as I felt the rivulets run down my leg and out across my foot. It was so easy... it was getting so much easier to just wet my pants. "Good girl," Mistress cooed at me as she felt me up, squeezed my pissy wet bottom. "That's my adorable little piss-pants elf."

Just like yesterday, I started my morning with an accident, and a ravishing, passionate, intense session of intercourse. Later that day, Mistress blessed me with the sight of her wetting her pants two more times, and she even put me in diapers. We could hardly keep our hands off each other- whatever had happened last night, it was as if some kind of wall was broken down between us. I don't know if she forgave me for my crimes, or if she had just forgotten about them, but I felt for the first time that I was more than just her slave, I was her girlfriend.

I realized that day, that I wanted to spend the rest of my long, long life, with her.

Thank you guys for your kind words. I've been super busy, I just uprooted my whole life and moved, so I haven't had any time for writing, but I'm going to post a new story soon. It's gonna be a little weird. Think like... H.P. Lovecraft blended with Sci-Fi Post-Apoc blended with anime-level superhumans. Also, underwater stuff.

And piss, yes, of course, piss.

*017*2022-04-30 20:34

I ask myself that question every other day... I work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week now, so I rarely have time to write. But I DO still want to add to this.

I can't decide which one I want to see the most. I think Her? I do love a good love story. I already copied the middle story and did a find and replace to make it less gory and to make the monster Lady D (don't worry, I'm not sharing it anywhere and stealing your work!). That first one still has so many places it can go, too.

Hey, better to have the muses bludgeoning you from all directions than to have them forget you exist!

I'm glad you liked it! I suppose if you're just keeping it for yourself thats alright
