My first work of omo fiction. Focuses on male humiliation. Feedback welcome, but please be nice!

Luke Stout was beginning to regret drinking so much water.

Of course, it was best to be hydrated before giving a presentation to the company that’s considering buying yours, especially if you’re the CEO. But he was beginning to feel a slight pressure in his bladder. Quite inconvenient. Still, he was certain he could make it through the half-hour that was left in the presentation with nothing more than a little discomfort. Today was practically guaranteed to end with a handshake and Chartr signing the deal to buy List Industries.

He’d just finished explaining the revenue from the company’s German market. “Any questions?” While he waited for hands to go up, he took a sip of the glass of flavored water that Chartr’s CEO, Madison Long, had kindly handed to him before the presentation began. It had a slight bitter aftertaste, but he managed to suppress his frown. It would be an insult to Madison to show that he didn’t like the drink.

One of the Chartr board members raised a hand, then asked a softball question about market percentage capture. Easy stuff. Luke could see his CFO smirking in the back of the room. He answered with dexterity, then went back to presenting. Yes, today was going to go great.

It wasn’t until he was halfway through the French/Swiss market and its unique challenges that he realized something was wrong. He really shouldn’t need to piss this badly, this quickly, unless something was wrong. Maybe he was sick? Still, there was nothing to do but continue. He couldn’t botch this. Not today. So what if the pressure in his bladder was making him talk a little more quickly—

Madison Long cleared her throat pointedly. Luke came to an abrupt, awkward stop. He wouldn’t stop like this for anyone else, but since Madison was the one putting her personal assets on the line, it was most important to cater to her.

“Yes?” Luke said, trying not to sound impatient. He glanced at the clock.

“You’re talking too fast,” Madison drawled, lips dark red and immaculate. “Slow down, please.”

Luke managed not to sigh. Of course she’d noticed. “Sorry about that, Ms. Long. I’m on it.”

Talking slow was almost torturous. With every passing minute, he needed to piss more and more. It was getting hard to keep his posture normal. If he weren’t giving the most important presentation of his life right now, he’d be crossing his legs tightly, or maybe even running to a bathroom—no. Don’t think about that now, he chided himself. That’ll only make it worse.

Another board member raised a hand with a question. Luke nodded through the first sentence, then tried to hang on as the question became increasingly complicated. He’d completely lost focus by the end, as his bladder twinged and he tried not to flinch. “I—I’m sorry,” he said hesitantly, “can you run that by me again?”

He glanced furtively over at Madison while he listened. Those lips were curved in a slight smirk.

Thankfully, after hearing the question a second time, Luke understood it. His heart sank as he realized he’d have to go back to some earlier slides to answer it. The clock made it obvious: he wouldn’t be finishing this whole presentation by the scheduled end time. Which meant waiting even longer.

He managed to get through answering the question. Barely. The twinges from his bladder were getting more frequent and harder to ignore.

Madison interrupted his next slide. “Do you not like the drink? It’s one of our top sellers.”

Luke looked over at the drink he’d been ignoring. Oh no. If it was a Chartr product, it was even ruder to avoid drinking it. For a moment, he considered furtively pouring it down his shirt, but no. That would be too obvious. He had to drink it.

He tried to get away with only taking a small sip, but a glance at Madison’s narrowed eyes told him everything he needed to know. He tried not to squirm as he took a gulp of the drink. What a strange, bitter taste. “It’s delicious,” he said. Was it obvious that his smile was fake?

By the time he got to the Chinese market, his bladder was past occasional twinges. Instead, he felt it swollen against his pants, constantly alerting him of his need to piss. He only had twenty more slides to go, and then he could—

“You’re talking too fast again,” Madison said.

Luke was sure his wince was visible this time. “Sorry. I’ll slow down.”

He was sure that the sweat beading on his forehead was visible now. Nineteen slides left, but he wasn’t sure he could make it. He took a pause to take another sip of the goddamn drink, and looked around furtively for answers as he swallowed.

The podium. That was his only hope. If he stood behind it, it’d block the view of his lower half, and he could cross his legs to his heart’s content. He moved over to that side of the room, bringing the drink with him.

Crossing his legs behind the podium made him feel safer, but also only reminded him of the constant pressure from his bladder. As he advanced the slides and took another sip, he felt a spasm from his bladder and flinched, hand reflexively flying towards his crotch. Then he froze. He could not be grabbing his crotch in front of the combined boards of two companies. With an awkward smile, he went back to presenting.

Every moment was torture, now. He really didn’t think he could make it. His legs were crossed as tightly as he could muster, but even so, the next spasm might be his undoing. At the next pause between slides, he made his decision.

“I’m sorry, everyone,” he said, trying to sound confident and not shaky. “I have to step out for a minute. I’ll be right back, just—”

“No,” said Madison Long.

“No?”

“You’re finishing the presentation.” Madison was smiling again, and Luke had no idea why, but that was not his top priority right now.

“I’m sorry, but it’s really not an option to—”

Madison stood, somehow graceful despite her high heels, and looked him straight in the eye. “Finish it.”

“Okay,” Luke found himself saying, even though he almost certainly could not do that. But it’s not like he had any other option. And there was a chance this still went well. There was a chance.

He looked back at his slides and kept talking, now with no hope of seeming on-point. Everyone in the room knew something was wrong. Him asking to step out had made sure of that. His only remaining chance was to keep them from knowing exactly what was wrong.

Luke stammered and stumbled through two more slides, legs crossed as tight as he can muster, and then it happened. With another spasm of his bladder, he felt a spurt of hot piss escape into his boxers. He was barely able to suppress the squeak that threatened to escape him, and he couldn’t stop his eyes closing and his hand flying to his crotch. After a tense moment of squeezing his muscles as tight as he could, he stopped pissing, but he could still feel the wetness in his boxers. He had no idea if it was visible.

It was abundantly clear that this wasn’t going to end well. Luke, face red hot, rushed through his last few slides with an apology. Only three minutes past the scheduled end time. “Thank you everyone. I’m now going to—”

“I have a question,” Madison interrupted.

Luke closed his eyes. As he did, another spurt of piss shot out of him, and he clenched his legs ever tighter. This was a losing battle. “Yes?”

Madison launched into her question. It was the most complicated one yet, and Luke lost track of it after the first subordinate clause. As he desperately tried to understand, she just kept talking, adding more and more conditions to the question. He felt another spurt escape, then another, and gave up on not holding his crotch, just trying to keep it together. When Madison finally came to a stop, Luke could only stare at her. “I’m not sure I understand.”

“Then I’ll say it again,” she said, and began repeating her question, only talking even slower. Luke couldn’t stop himself from rocking back and forth, fidgeting, trying everything he possibly could to keep from pissing himself.

Then, as Madison was still talking, a spurt became a hot jet and just kept going, piss beginning to flood his pants. With a yelp, Luke started to run from the room, clutching himself and pissing through his dress pants all the way, leaving a wet trail behind him. He heard laughter and scoffs from the assembled board members, and his cheeks flushed completely red. He could not believe he was pissing himself in front of the executives of two companies.

Outside the boardroom, he fumbled with his pants, still pissing desperately, then gave up and just let it all rush out of him, leaning against the wall, eyes closed. It felt amazing. His legs shook with the pleasure, but he couldn’t stop thinking about how thoroughly he’d embarrassed himself.

When he opened his eyes, Madison was standing in front of him, still wearing that smirk. He looked away, unwilling to meet her eyes. “I’m so sorry, Ms. Long. I promise this isn’t—”

“We’ll buy,” she said.

Luke could only stare. “What?”

“We’ll buy List Industries. Congratulations.”

“But I—”

“Stop talking. You win.”

Luke opened his mouth, then closed it. “You don’t want to shake hands?”

Madison scoffed. “Look at your hands. No, thank you, Luke. We’re going to have so much fun working together.” And with that, she turned to leave, heels clicking down the hallway. “Go get yourself cleaned up,” she shot over her shoulder.

The Chartr board members followed Madison without a word, leaving Luke to meet the incredulous gazes of his own executive team.

This was going to take some damage control.

As requested, more Luke & Madison 🙂 Enjoy!

Luke’s already struggling not to squirm in his seat when the message comes in. It’s from Madison, of course.

Another two ounces in the next five minutes.

He only briefly takes his eyes off his camera to send a thumbs-up in response. Madison’s gotten him a water bottle with clearly marked ounce gradations as part of their little arrangement, as she calls it. Another part of that is that he keeps notifications of her messages on at all times. There’s no real downtime. Not when you’re the CEO, and not when you’re Madison Long’s… whatever he is.

Right now, for instance, it doesn’t matter that he’s booked solid with virtual meetings for the next hour and a half. No, when Madison messages, Luke drinks. And tries not to let anything show on his face.

She’s also given him a particular challenge, today. He’s sitting on a lovely soft pink folded towel that is, apparently, precious to Madison. She was very clear and particular about the fact that the towel was not, under any circumstances, to get wet. And Luke hates to disappoint her.

Grudgingly, he takes a gulp of water, then nods approvingly at something one of the board members said in the meeting. But that’s not nearly two ounces. He’ll need to keep drinking.

Two ounces of water and fifteen minutes later, Madison messages again. Another ounce, five minutes.

This time, already jiggling his legs under the desk, he can’t keep a small grimace from his face.

“Everything all right, Mr. Stout?” a board member asks. “I thought we were on the same page with this proposal.”

“Oh, yes, no worries,” Luke says blandly. “I saw a spider on the wall.” That isn’t a great excuse, he admonishes himself, but at least he kept his composure.

But I’m not thirsty, he messages Madison on the other screen, aware of how petulant and desperate that makes him sound.

Her reply is swift. Drink anyway, Luke.

He can’t say no to Madison. Not really. He takes another drink and crosses his legs under the desk, rubbing his thighs for comfort. It doesn’t help against the growing pressure in his bladder.

I did it, he sends eventually, hoping it’ll make him feel better.

It doesn’t, really. Neither does Madison’s reply: That’s a good boy.

At Madison’s instructions, he’s nearly drained the bottle by the time the meeting ends fifteen minutes later. Only another hour of meetings to go, but the soft towel underneath him is a reminder of just how long that hour might feel.

By the time another half hour has passed, he’s having trouble sitting still. He tries valiantly to keep his squirming confined to under the desk, but it’s hard to think about anything other than the fact that he really needs to piss.

“Mr. Stout?” a director says, and he realizes that he’s failed to respond to something he was supposed to respond to.

“Ah—sorry. Say again?” He clenches his legs under the desk and hopes it’ll be enough.

The director frowns. “Is everything all right, Mr. Stout?”

Shit. “Yes, everything’s fine. I…” He can’t think of a good excuse. “I was momentarily distracted. What did you say before?”

As the director reiterates his question, Luke’s bladder twinges and he freezes, clenching his legs even tighter together. He manages to stop himself from leaking, but just barely.

God, he doesn’t want to think of what Madison will do to him if he gets the towel wet. But these meetings are so long.

Just as the director finishes talking, another message from Madison comes in. Two ounces, three minutes. Luke manages to choke out an answer to the question before taking some hasty gulps of water, wincing as his bladder twinges again. This is getting more and more difficult.

After another ten minutes or so, Luke is barely hanging on, crossing his legs for dear life under the desk. Sometimes, he has to sacrifice his left hand to hold himself, thankfully below the view of the camera. Then, as he holds himself, his bladder clenches even more firmly, and he feels a spurt of hot liquid flood his boxers.

Luke yelps, then freezes, realizing he wasn’t muted.

“Mr. Stout?” says one of his board members.

“Sorry,” he says, voice oddly high-pitched, “spider.” The moisture has soaked into his pants, making a visible dark spot on the front of his gray dress pants. The hand he was using to hold himself is wet, too, but the towel still seems to be dry. It’s fine. He can sit like this until the meeting ends, damp but all right, and then—

“Sir,” says the board member, “if this isn’t a good time, we can reschedule.”

Luke glances over at his calendar. The block of time after this meeting ends is just labeled Madison, and after that he has no more free time today. “Let’s go ahead,” he says. “I apologize.”

“All right,” the board member says, sounding dubious.

Luke makes an extra effort to listen, still holding himself. Squirming openly now is the sacrifice he has to make to be able to pay attention, he decides, so he ignores the weird looks that the board members are giving him.

Despite the pressure of his legs and his hand, he soon feels another trickle of urine into his boxers, and then another. The dark spot on his pants is widening, and he doesn’t want to think about what the towel looks like. He just has to get through this meeting.

Blessedly, the meeting ends only a few leaks later. The dampness in his pants hasn’t had time to cool before there’s a knock on his door.

“Who is it?” Luke calls out. He doesn’t want anyone to see him like this, other than…

“It’s me.” The voice is unmistakably Madison.

Luke sighs. “Come in.”

She enters the room calm and utterly unruffled. “How were your meetings?”

“Well, they’re done now.” He looks down at his still-clenched legs and softens it with a laugh.

“And my towel?”

He’s silent.

“Luke.” Madison’s disappointed and still somehow patronizing. “Did you get my towel wet?”

“I did my best. I couldn’t—”

“Show me the towel.”

Reluctantly and gingerly, he stands up and brings the towel from the chair. There’s a definite wet spot on it.

“Oh, Luke. Couldn’t even hold it for ninety minutes. Look at your pants.”

He looks down, face heating. There’s a substantial wet patch, clearly visible now that he’s out from behind his desk. That reminds him just how badly he has to go, and with another twinge from his bladder, he has to cross his legs again.

“How embarrassing.” Madison is smiling. It’s never good when she’s smiling. “You know, if you had kept my towel dry, I would’ve let you go relieve yourself now.”

Oh no. “But I really have to—” he tries.

“Too bad.” She takes a few steps towards him and tips his chin up with one hand. “You’re just going to have to hold it until I say you can go.”

“I don’t think I can hold it much longer…”

Madison says nothing.

Luke clutches his cock again, despite the wetness already in his pants, because if he doesn’t do something he’s about to piss himself right now. Madison just stands there and watches him squirm with that faint smile.

Finally, Luke tries: “What do I need to do?” It’s hard to speak, but he has to do something, otherwise he’s just going to piss himself while Madison looks on.

“Hmm. I’d like a paperclip.”

“...A paperclip?”

“Yes. Get me one from the copy room.”

Oh, so she wants him to leave his office and walk down the hall to the copy room, so desperate he’s practically bursting, with a visible wet spot on his pants. Dammit. Dammit. “Okay,” he mumbles, and risks uncrossing his legs to move out the door.

Once outside, every step is a trial, especially as he tries to angle himself so that anyone in the nearby cubicles will see as little of his wet pants as possible. He has to shuffle slowly along the hall, making sure to keep his legs as near as possible. When he’s halfway to the copy room, he feels another hot spurt of piss into his boxers. Crossing his legs ever so tightly stops the leak, for now, but he brings his head up sharply as he hears footsteps. It’s a director he’s not very familiar with, who gives him a confused look as she passes by. He manages a nod.

Somehow, he makes it to the copy room and retrieves a single paperclip. It feels so silly, but all he can think of is how badly he needs Madison to tell him that he can go take a piss somewhere other than his pants, and the paperclip is what she asked for. As his bladder twinges again, he decides that it might be a better idea to walk a little faster this time, as risky as it feels.

Most of the way back to his office, he feels a spasm from his bladder, and he feels hot wetness in his pants again, but this time it doesn’t stop when he crosses his legs. Luke can’t help letting a quiet “no, no, no,” escape as he begins to completely piss himself. Still pissing, holding himself with one hand, he sprints the remaining ten feet to his office and throws open the door. Once inside, he lets it go, hot piss running down his legs and onto his shoes and office floor.

It feels so good to let go, but he’s suddenly very aware that Madison hadn’t actually told him he could. Under her steely gaze, he tries to stop himself from pissing, crossing his legs and holding himself again, but it doesn’t work.

“Well,” Madison says, once he’s made a complete mess of himself. “Did I tell you you could do that?”

“No,” he whispers, looking down at the puddle he’s made around his soaked dress pants. “I’m sorry.”

“You should be.” Then she lets the silence stretch out for a little too long.

“What are you going to make me do?” he asks, eventually.

“Oh, nothing too bad. You’ll just have to clean it up.”

“Myself?”

“Of course, Luke. You made the mess, after all.”

He looks back down at his soaked pants, trying to remember how far he’ll have to walk to get at the cleaning supplies. “Okay,” he says eventually. “Thank you, Madison.”

“My pleasure,” she replies, with a curve of her lips.
