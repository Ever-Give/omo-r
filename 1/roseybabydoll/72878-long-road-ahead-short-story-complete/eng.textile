Summary: Stepsiblings Zoe and Sebastian are on a long road trip. When Zoe has too much to drink, Sebastian decides to offer his assistance.

Gas station icees were a bit of a kryptonite for Zoe. Any combination of ice and syrup really was a go to, especially on a road trip. Who doesn’t love blue raspberry? Although Cherry is a safe second choice. The way it turns her tongue red compliments the curly ginger hair that bounces just past her shoulders and the freckles that pepper her cheeks. Red feels… flirtier. She knows that when she buys it, feels a prickle of shame heat her cheeks when she takes the drink back out to the minivan and slides into the backseat.

Flirty shouldn’t be even remotely on her mind when she’s in the middle of a twelve hour road trip with her stepfamily. Sure, Dad is here, but he’s in his own world with Cynthia (a picture perfect stepmother though Zoe could really take her or leave her), so he’s no distraction. The issue is Sebastian. Well, it’s not really an issue per se. It can’t be an issue if she pretends she isn’t feeling a squirmy kind of attraction to the son of her dad’s second wife. That’s not like an actual brother, she tells herself over and over, but it doesn’t stop the twinge of guilt she feels when he makes her heart beat fast.

She was seventeen when her dad remarried and the new wife came with a kid of her own. Sebastian is her same age, both nineteen now and home from college for Christmas — thus the roadtrip to Colorado for the holiday. Did they have to pick such a romantic family

@@vacation? A cabin with a fireplace isn’t the easiest place to keep her mind from wandering.

She never thought attraction would be an issue when her dad brought her to meet him for the first time. Zoe pictured a zit-faced teenage boy who would probably interrupt her all the time and be at least sixty percent an asshole, but Sebastian was… softer? He was nice. He was tall and thin and told her how he likes to read, what video games he plays, and they actually had a lot in common. She likes that he paints his nails black, that he wears a little eyeliner, that he’s into fashion enough to actually dress cute, and that he’s actually a bit feminine. He was different.

They’ve spent just enough time together to be good friends, but not nearly enough to feel like siblings. It makes it even harder to quell the way her heart thumps when he cocks an eyebrow from the seat right beside her.

“That thing is giant,” he says with a glance at the icee before turning back to the video game in his hands, leaning back in the seat and button-mashing to his heart’s content. They’re both seated in the back row out of three in the car, providing a decent barrier between them and their parents who have just finished fueling up and will probably spend the next three hours lost in singing show tunes or some terrible talk radio. It feels weirdly… private. “You’re gonna have to pee a million times.”

“No I won’t, it’s fine,” she says, taking a long sip of the cherry flavored slush before setting it in a cup holder and getting comfortable for the ride. Her skirt rides up to her upper thighs when she sits so she tugs it down a little in a show of modesty and buckles the seatbelt.

Sebastian pops his earbuds in and Zoe tries not to be disappointed about being ignored, choosing instead to put her headphones on and sip her drink for the next hour or so on the road.

She wasn’t lying when she said her bladder wouldn’t be an issue. She doesn’t get desperate often or easily and she’s definitely no stranger to a Big Gulp on the road, but maybe the ice or her nerves being in a back seat with Sebastian are weakening her tolerance.

An hour goes by and she feels that her bladder is filling, but she can hold it for a while before getting uncomfortable.

Another thirty minutes and she is uncomfortable. Sebastian took his earbuds out and put his game away a little bit ago, gazing half asleep out the window. It makes it hard to squirm subtly.

Zoe would just ask for a rest stop, she isn’t too shy not to, but they’re on a long country highway, far from any rest areas. Stopping will mean having to pee on the side of the road or wandering into the creepy roadside woods to do it. One of those options is way too embarrassing with her step brother right here and the other is too creepy (and she is not going to get bitten by ticks just for modesty).

She tries to distract herself with her phone, but eventually she has thighs clamped together hard, trying to fight off little waves of desperation. Right when Zoe feels she’s got it under control, the car hits a pothole hard and she gasps, instinctually thrusting a hand between her legs to hold herself.

“You good?” Sebastian frowns, half teasing, half actually seeming concerned.

“I’m fine,” she says with a guilty glance towards the empty icee cup.

“You have to pee,” he laughs. “I told you. Ask your dad to pull over.”

A quick glance to the driver’s seat gives all the information Zoe needs to know they won’t be stopping any time soon — him and Cynthia have put an audiobook on. They’re doomed. “There’s no bathroom.”

“Just go in the grass.”

“Dude, I’m not like you. I can’t just whip it out and I don’t want to get ticks or some other weird bug bite.”

Sebastian shrugs his shoulders, but he doesn’t seem to be shifting his attention away from the present situation. If anything, he seems a little too attentive to it. “What’re you gonna do then?”

“I’m just gonna hold it.”

“You can’t hold it that long.” He rolls his eyes. “Are you just embarrassed? I can ask him to stop.”

“I’m not going outside,” she blushes, one hand still stuffed under her skirt, pressing hard against her pussy through thin pink panties. Fuck, she’s been talking to Sebastian this whole time with her hand like this. “Don’t say anything.”

“I won’t, but you seriously look like you’re gonna burst.” He glances towards the large empty cup that’s put Zoe in her current predicament. “There, just go in that.”

“What?!” She hisses, face going bright red at the thought of not just peeing in a cup, but doing it in front of him. “No way.”

“Why? It’s big enough.”

Her heart pounds. Why does it seem like he wants her to do that in front of him? She’s glad the sound of the road and the book in the speakers are keeping their conversation from being overheard right now because something suddenly feels much more… inappropriate. Is she throbbing a little between her legs because she’s desperate to relieve herself or because she’s excited that Sebastian is technically trying to goad her out of her panties?

“That’s so gross, where would we even put it after?”

“Put the lid on, tie it in a plastic bag, throw it out when we stop,” Sebastian says like the solution is perfectly obvious and entirely reasonable, but then he looks at her and his expression is soft with that little hint of genuine worry. “If you have to go, don’t hurt yourself, okay? For real, you can hurt your kidneys and stuff.”

“I…” Zoe feels her cheeks burning red. The offer is a little tempting. She has to go so fucking bad now and on top of that, she’s curious to see if Sebastian would look away or if he would try and sneak a peek at her while she peed. “I can’t pee in a cup. That’s too embarrassing.”

“I wouldn’t tell anyone.” He shrugs his shoulders. “But suit yourself.”

Zoe lets out a little huff and squirms again, parting her thighs so she can put her second hand between her legs and squeeze tight. They’re already talking about her openly pissing in front of him, so she can handle holding herself at least. It’s embarrassing, but it’s helping her hold on.

She shifts her gaze out the window and tries to find anything to distract her from how desperate she’s becoming, but there’s nothing but the same old pine trees lining the road, not even an animal in sight. She winces hard when another desperate wave hits her and the car rolls over a bump in the road at the worst moment.

She feels a trickle leak out, making her panties warm and damp in a small spot, but it makes it a million times harder to stop herself from letting go of more once she feels that wetness. “Fuck,” Zoe says under her breath.

“You good?”

“I… I just went a tiny bit.” She swallows hard and feels her hands tremble slightly against her damp panties. “Look, can you just… do you have a phone signal? Look up life hacks for holding your pee or something.”

“I have a signal,” he chuckles a little as he pulls his phone from his pocket and begins to research some tips that will hopefully lead to a solution that isn’t Zoe pissing in a cup.

Zoe watches him in anticipation, eager for anything that might be able to help her hold on, but all she sees is a faint blush creeping up Sebastian’s cheeks. “What does it say?”

“Uh… nothing, I didn’t really find anything helpful.”

“Bullshit, just tell me,” Zoe whines. She hears the childishness in her voice, but she’s too desperate to care. “Are you just pretending you didn’t find anything so I’ll pee myself? Don’t be weird.”

His blush deepens. “No, it just… the tips say to, ah…” He glances awkwardly away, something Zoe might find shy and kind of cute if she wasn’t about to have an accident in front of him. “They said to think, like, sexy thoughts and to touch yourself. It said it’ll distract the body part that has to pee or something, so that you’ll forget how bad you have to go.”

Zoe wonders if she’s running a fever with how hard she’s blushing, but before she can insist that’s weird and she’d never do that, two things happen. First, her clit throbs in an undeniable announcement that she's turned on hearing Sebastian talk about the possibility of her masturbating. Second, she dribbles into her panties again. Sebastian is staring at her like he’s been hypnotized, face pink. He has to be wondering if she’ll really do it. Does he want her to? Would it freak him out? Zoe doesn’t know if he sees her as a sister or not. Maybe… Maybe he should see her that way. Maybe she can use that to keep this situation from being so weird — siblings share bathrooms, right? This is just… bathroom related. It’s medical, even.

“Don’t look at me okay,” she glares at him to show she means it, but can’t help but hope he watches anyways as she tugs her panties to the side beneath her skirt and slides two fingers between the slick folds of her pussy. Fuck, she’s soaking wet and it’s not from those little leaks. She’s undeniably horny and insanely wet as she rubs her clit in circles with two fingers, taking a deep breath and trying to focus on the feeling of masturbating more than the feeling of pressure in her bladder. The motions of her hand make what she’s doing obvious, but at least the skirt over her lap creates the illusion that she’s hidden.

“Is it working?” Sebastian asks, sitting awkwardly with his legs crossed as he keeps his eyes respectfully cast away from Zoe.

“I don’t know. I still have to go really bad,” Zoe winces. This is so confusing and embarrassing at the same time. She’s touching herself right next to her step brother. She’s panicking about being so close to peeing herself in the car. She’s insanely aroused and can’t seem to stop touching herself now that she’s started and she doesn’t know if she wants Sebastian to touch her or if she’s a freak for thinking about it. “Was there anything else online that might help?”

“Um… there was one other tip, but you won’t want to do it. I don’t want you to think I’m being a creep if I say it.”

“What is it?” Zoe asks, her heart beating in her throat.

Sebastian squirms a little bit in his seat, bundling his jacket in his lap a bit. “It said if there’s someone else with you, it helps if you sit on their thigh or use their hand.”

A wave of heat seems to roll over Zoe’s whole body. It’s impossible to deny it now, she wants to be touched. She likes the thought of straddling Sebastian’s thigh and pressing her pussy up against it. She wants his hand to hold her through her panties right now.

“Look, um…” Sebastian lowers his voice, looking away from her eyes as he speaks. “If you’re really, really desperate, you can use my hand, okay? If it’ll help.”

Zoe’s heart pounds. “Really?”

“I mean you’re my sister technically right? So it’s not weird if I’m just… helping you.”

“Y-Yeah, I mean you’re my brother technically too so it’s not like it’d be sexual.” It’s a blatant lie and they both know it, but it’s a lie that gives them the courage to cross the line with one another.

Zoe inches a little closer to him, not too much, but they’re hidden well by the car seats. She tenses her body hard to hold it and removes her hands, lifting her skirt and spreading her legs. Like this, her panties are on display. The crotch has a discernible damp spot and the shape of her pussy is somewhat visible through the clingy fabric. “Wait, what if I pee on you?” She gulps, her arousal on hold in light of this very real and mortifying possibility. Wouldn’t Sebastian be grossed out?

“It’s whatever,” he says, eyes locked on to her panties. Fuck, she’s never seen him look hungry like that before. “Hand?”

Zoe takes a deep breath and nods.

Carefully, like he knows what they’re doing is wrong and incredibly inappropriate, he pretends to look out the window while his hand moves onto Zoe’s thigh, sliding up the inside until she scoots just a little closer. He cups her pussy tight through the panties then, laying his hand over the fabric and squeezing. “Does that help?” He asks, still looking away.

“Yeah,” Zoe breathes, her heart threatening to beat right out of her chest. His hand is bigger than it looks and the heel of his palm is pressing right on her clit. Is he doing that on purpose? “Thanks.”

“No problem,” Sebastian says, shifting again in his seat a little as he squeezes her through the panties.

They stay like that for a few minutes, Zoe chewing her lip and enjoying the pressure against her clit when a bump in the road startles her. She holds onto her pee this time, but she instinctively grabs Sebastian’s hand, pressing it down harder and pushing her hips up against it.

“Shit, sorry, sorry,” she whispers even though she’s still squirming, rubbing herself right against where her step brother’s hand is hostage.

“It’s fine, do what you have to do,” Sebastian says and then starts moving his hand of his own accord, sliding it up a little and rubbing her clit in circles through the panties. “Does that help?”

Zoe thinks her panties might be soaked for an entirely different reason now. Fuck, it feels really good. His fingers are bigger than her own and he’s pressing down just right. “Yeah, it helps,” she blushes. “Don’t let Dad and Cynthia notice.”

“I won’t.” He nods his head and glances down, watching where he’s rubbing her through the wet panties. Zoe feels her whole body heat under his gaze and she’s so distracted for a moment by how hot the situation feels, she dribbles a little more into her panties and, subsequently, against her step brother’s hand.

“Sorry!” She squeaks in a harsh whisper.

“Dude, you’re literally peeing yourself,” Sebastian says, his face flushed pink and his eyes fixated on the large wet spot. “You can’t keep holding it like this.”

“If you don’t want to help me hold it that’s fine, but don’t-“

“I didn’t say that, I just… I don’t know.” He bites his lip, still staring, still rubbing her. The panties are undeniably wet now, making the fabric feel slightly rougher against Zoe’s clit. It makes the friction even better

Zoe sees that he’s squirming and her heart pounds when she sees how obvious his boner has gotten. Fuck, they’re both turned on by this, but she’s genuinely about to piss herself. Won’t that disgust him? Sebastian rubs her clit in just the right way to tickle ever so slightly and another leak escapes, a few drops trickling through the panties and onto the seat. “Shit, shit,” she breathes, lifting herself up an inch to yank her skirt up so it isn’t underneath her. Another leak — a perfect dribble of wet warmth over Sebastian’s fingers and her wet panties, teasing her with relief.

“You’re peeing,” Sebastian says in a near whisper, his cool demeanor dissipated, eyes wide in amazement as he looks directly at his hand in her panties and the new wet spot on the car seat. “Does it hurt?”

Zoe feels tears welling in her eyes and nods.

Sebastian keeps stroking her. “Just go,” he says, his cheeks splotched pink as he squirms in his seat. Does he want her to piss herself? Does the thought turn him on? He just told her to pee, but his hand hasn’t left her pussy.

“Won’t you be grossed out?”

Sebastian shakes his head. “Nah, it’s okay. I mean… this kind of thing happens.” He swallows hard and even leans in a little as if to get a better look. “You should um… take your panties off if you’re just gonna pee the seat though.”

Zoe’s clit throbs at the proposition. So he does want to see. He wants to see her without panties on. She glances towards the front seat where her dad and Cynthia are singing along to something far too loudly to notice the hissing sound of her pissing the backseat, so she looks at Sebastian and gives a nod. When she lifts her hips, Sebastian takes his hand away and she tugs her panties down and off in a quick motion, tucking the damp underwear in the pocket of the seat in front of her and collecting her skirt up around her waist.

“I can’t believe I’m doing this,” she says under her breath, tears of humiliation still pricking at her eyes, but when she opens her legs, Sebastian is still staring. He’s looking at her pussy like he’s mesmerized by it, but before she can even think to be aroused or show it off, she’s peeing.

Zoe closes her eyes with a whimper as she starts to dribble onto the seat below her, fighting it for maybe a second at most before the floodgates unleash and she’s full on pissing right into the soft fabric of the car seat. She angles her pelvis straight down, not letting it arc onto the floor or make too loud of a hissing sound as she tries not to moan in relief. Her thighs tremble and she feels absolutely humiliated, but also unbelievably horny. It feels so good to let go, but the warm wetness of the puddle against her pussy is making her want to rub her clit. She wants Sebastian to rub her clit.

When she gathers the courage to open her eyes, she finds that Sebastian has his hand down his pants, gripping his dick and playing with himself as he watches her piss with half-lidded eyes and parted lips. Zoe feels her mouth water, her heart rabbiting in her chest as she looks at him. She’s still dribbling, but she isn’t closing her legs. Instead, no matter how fiercely she’s blushing, she looks at where Sebastian is touching himself and puts her hand between her own legs. She leans back in the seat and rubs her clit with two fingers, her chest heaving with the quickness of her breath.

“Sorry, I just… fuck, I’m a guy, you know? I can’t see your whole… I can’t look at you naked and not…” Sebastian sounds ashamed, but his hand is still moving.

“It’s fine, we can both just… take care of ourselves,” Zoe says, burning red as she rubs her pussy, her ass soaked as she sits in the wet spot. The car seat has absorbed the puddle beneath her already. God she hopes her dad doesn’t look in the rear view mirror any time soon. They’re covered by the middle car seats, but her face could give everything away. “Swear you won’t tell anyone I had an accident, okay?” She says, eyes fixed on Sebastian’s hand in his pants. “And you have to help me next time we stop. It’s obvious I wet myself and I don’t want to explain to Dad and Cynthia by myself.”

“Sure.” Sebastian nods eagerly, biting his lip as he pushes his hips up against his hand. “You’re a really cool step sister, you know. I mean… it’s cool that we’re not blood related, so we can like masturbate and stuff back here to kill time and it’s not weird or anything.”

“Yeah, totally not weird.” Zoe nearly sighs in relief as she teases the excited bud of her clit and watches him. God, she wants to see his dick for real. He got to see her bare pussy. In fact, he’s still looking at it! It would only be fair for him to show her, right? “You can take it out if you want. I’m not gonna freak out or anything.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yeah. You saw mine already, so let me see yours too.”

Sebastian glances cautiously at their parents then, seeing they’re still more than distracted, fully lifts his hips and shoves his jeans all the way down past his knees. The seatbelt rests on his abdomen, nothing obstructing the view as he spreads his legs a little bit and leans back leisurely in the car seat, sighing as he starts to steadily stroke his dick.

Zoe is stunned. He’s blushing, but he seems so… comfortable. She watches as Sebastian licks his lips and stares at her pussy while he tugs rhythmically on his cock. He’s shaved completely, maybe even waxed, his dick hard and flushed pink, full and proportional to his size — not too big, but certainly not small. She swallows her pounding heart and mimics his energy, leaning back in the seat and holding her legs wide open as she casually, almost lazily, plays with her pussy and watches him stroke.

“You’re so fucking hot,” Sebastian sighs, eyes half lidded. “I’m sorry I just can’t even… could I maybe…”

“Maybe what?” Zoe asks, rolling her hips a little against her hand just for show.

“Could I see your tits?” Sebastian asks, face bright pink as he tugs his dick and stares at Zoe’s chest through her dress. “They’re not paying attention.” He cocks his head towards their parents.

Zoe shoots them a nervous glance, making sure they’re still distracted before she nods and tugs down the front of her dress. She doesn’t dare take the straps off, but pulls it down enough to tuck under her perky breasts, showing them off to Sebastian as she continues stroking her pussy.

Sebastian lets out a quiet moan and leans against the car door as he jerks off, his pace quickening. “You’re such a cool step sister for this. Fuck…”

“But you can’t tell anyone about my accident, got it?”

“I won’t,” Sebastian promises. “God, I swear I’m not gross or anything, but seeing you do that was kind of hot.”

“Peeing?”

He bites his lips and nods.

“Really?” Zoe blushes and thinks for a moment, swirling her fingers around her sensitive clit. Her bladder has already filled up a tiny bit again, would he like it if she…?

Zoe reaches out and grabs Sebastian’s hand — the one that isn’t furiously stroking that cute little dick — so she can place it right between her legs. She presses his hand over her pussy and nudges her hips forward against it. She hopes this won’t freak him out, but he said he liked it right? With her heart hammering, she summons her courage and dribbles a little bit against his hand, whimpering quietly as he rubs her.

“That’s so fucking hot,” he says with wide eyes, continuing to stroke himself with a tight fist as he plays with her clit. His eyes light up when she lets another little trickle out over his fingers.

“Well now you have to keep my accident a secret or I’ll tell people you have a piss kink,” Zoe teases with a breathy laugh. Surprisingly, she’s actually getting kind of close. Sebastian’s fingers feel good as he rubs the bud of her clit and she uses a free hand to start pinching and toying with her nipple.

“I thought about you,” Sebastian admits, looking hypnotized as his hands work over himself and Zoe at a similar pace. His voice is low, so they won’t be heard over the music, but his words are clear. “I jerked off thinking about you.”

Zoe’s heart pounds so hard, she wonders if he can hear it. “What did you think about?”

He pushes his hips up against his own fist. “I accidentally saw you naked last summer,” he blushes. “At the lake house. You were changing into your bathing suit in the changing room by the water and there was a big space between the wall and the curtain and I saw you.”

Fuck, why is that so hot? She should be mortified, but instead, Zoe whimpers. “Fuck.”

“So I’ve thought a lot about fucking you and eating you out,” Sebastian sighs, his hand quickening on his dick. “If we can keep our parents from finding out, we could be friends with benefits or something, you know? We could experiment with whatever we want so when we get in like… actual relationships, we’ll be good at it.”

God, that sounds like heaven. “I’d be down,” Zoe says, worrying her lower lip between her teeth as he rubs her clit in slick little circles. “What would you want to experiment with?”

“Licking you.” Sebastian says without hesitation, thumbing at the tip of his dick and swallowing a moan. “Maybe uh… Are you turned on by the piss thing too? Like… if you saw me have an accident?”

Zoe had never thought about that before. Maybe it’s her soaked pussy doing the talking, but fuck, that sounds so hot. “That’d be so hot, oh my God.” She laughs a little at the absurdity, but rolls her hips against his hand. “Yeah, I’d want to see you piss yourself too.”

“I think I’m gonna come,” Sebastian whispers, eyes still fixated on Zoe’s spread open legs. “Where should I…”

“Here.” Zoe snatches her wet panties since she won’t be able to put them on again anyways.

“Holy shit.” Sebastian takes his hand away from her pussy to grab the panties and presses them against his dick, squirming as he tugs himself faster, faster, then stops and shivers as he comes into them.

Zoe touches herself as she watches. He makes the cutest face when he comes, all blushy with his eyes closed and mouth hanging open. Seeing him spill into her panties is all she needs to come with a whimper, her oversensitive bladder reacting to the orgasm by trickling a light stream against her hand as she rubs her clit to her pleasure’s fruition.

“Wow,” she sighs, head lolling back against the car seat. “Dude… That was so good.”

“Yeah,” Sebastian chuckles, wiping himself clean with the panties and stashing them in the pocket of the seat in front of him before tucking his dick away. “I’ll have my accident at the hotel later tonight, yeah? I can stand in the bath tub or something.”

“Perfect.”

He reaches back into the trunk and snags a folded up beach towel as Zoe tugs her dress back up over her breasts, still perky and excited from what they just got away with. “Here,” he says, handing it to her. “You can sit on it to hide the seat and no one will even know you had an accident.”

Zoe takes it and nods, lifting up and stuffing the towel underneath her before sitting again. To keep her dress dry, she has to keep it hiked up around her waist, her lower half remaining exposed. “You can’t tell anyone about our benefits though, okay? You’re still my stepbrother… people can’t know.”

“I won’t say anything. I mean, you know about my kink now, so… I wouldn’t break the secret.” Sebastian looks her over with a knowing gaze and smirks as he reaches for his water bottle, taking a big long gulp before setting it aside. “I think the next bathroom is still a few hours away.”

End.
