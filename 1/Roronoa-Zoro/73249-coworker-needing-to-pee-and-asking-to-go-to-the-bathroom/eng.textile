I helped a co-worker (she does deliveries)and she drinks nothing but Dr pepper.and when we got the the house of the guy. that we where delivering to my co-worker say ineed to piss.and I say( to her you can go in the woods but she say how professional would that be if he comes out and sees me.) and she keeps saying ineed2pee and she is about to piss herself and doing a pee pee dance a crossing her leg. in my head I am like I do not need to know that.and then she say I can't wait anymore and asks the man if she can use the bathroom.

And by the way she in 50 years of age and not hot. But all of what she said and did almost gave me a boner. 3:53pm this co-worker that I talked about is going to be my ride home because I don't have a car and she comes to the break room telling me she needs to piss and runs to the bathroom so I don't know why she tells me this stuff. I did not tell her that I'm into omorashi and I don't know if she's into it but I'm not going to ask

Feel free to reply to I guess my adventures with the co-worker criticism is wanted
