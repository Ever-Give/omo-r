Hey everyone, I’ve been a long-time lurker, and I have finally decided to contribute! Leading me to write short stories about a chain of thought which randomly popped up in my mind.

We’ve been fortunate to find forums like these, where we can open up, share and discuss our beloved interests. I am pretty sure that many of us here have even confided our likes to other people, aka loved ones. However, I feel there will be many folks out there who haven’t had an opportunity to disclose this aspect about themselves or their interests, due to many reasons. People in this category can range from all walks of life, different countries, genders and so on.

I wanted to create this thread that brings out these fictional stories of people, where they haven’t expressed this fetish of theirs to anyone, or have discovered platforms around the fetish, or they find ways to disclose to a loved one.

A slice of life kind of thing, where I try to develop instances of different kinds. To be honest, this is going to be a pure experimentation. I am hopeful it will turn out to be interesting, and some of you might like it.

STORY ONE - A FRIEND INDEED

(Only wetting in this story)

Introvert

Noun: a quiet, shy person who prefers to be alone than with other people.

A living example to this definition was Mark. A timid boy, mostly soft-spoken, someone who often kept to himself. Recently, Mark had endured a bitter-sweet experience of turning 18. What initially turned out to be uncomfortable, soon took a pleasant turn. You see, to someone who’s of his age, outgoing by nature, who looks forward to social interactions and gatherings, the event which unfolded would’ve been a cherished memory. But Mark was never a social butterfly, so naturally, things were different.

His mother, Rachel, a farmer and a single parent, had invited a bunch of family members over for a surprise birthday bash. Days before her son’s birthday, a round of calls were made to close relatives, inviting them over for the surprise. Usually, Rachel would keep things low key, just how her son would like things to be. But this time, the situation was different. Recently, Mark’s childhood friend Bella had moved out of town. This definitely impacted Mark, and the signs were evident. He had withdrawn further into his shell, spent most of his time alone, either in his room or the long walks that he often took.

Rachel tried talking to Mark, but he shut her off with his usual response “I am okay mom”. As a mother, Rachel was concerned, and had to do something to help her son. Last week however, she was in for a surprise. From time to time, Rachel would clean Mark’s room. Small things like collecting his dirty laundry, dusting his table, and changing his sheets. Not that he wouldn’t do it himself, it’s just that Rachel knew he did an average job in that department.

While Rachel was tending to the task, she couldn’t help but notice an open diary, laying on Mark’s desk. With all that had been happening recently, Rachel found it hard to keep her curiosity at bay, and ended up running her eyes through the passage that was written.

23.05.2024 - 10:45PM - I finally managed to do it. While watching the movie with mom, I leaked in my underwear. It felt so naughty! The potential of getting caught was high. Ever since I returned from my walk, I was holding it all in. I was so anxious to ease my bladder. But I pushed past the fear, and relaxed. It felt so good! So warm! And so naughty! Mom had absolutely no idea. It was a thing that mom started to doze off. Leading me to leak more. But when it started to show in my shorts, I stopped. I excused myself, telling her I was tired, and came back to my room. Like every night, I peed out from the window. I am not ready to pee on the bedroom floor yet, and definitely scared to wet the bed. So let’s see how things goâ€¦

Disbelief engulfed Rachel. What had she just read? Her son liked to pee his pants? Slowly lowering herself on Mark’s bed, Rachel found it hard to find a suitable reaction. The entry she had just read was from yesterday. Unable to help herself, she reached out for the diary, and flipped a page.

22.05.2024 - 06:45PM - Monsoon’s finally here! Mom and I were worried about the rains. We really hoped it wouldn’t be like the previous year. All our efforts would then go vain, and it’s hard to see mom worried all the time. The sunflowers look healthy, and this time I am sure we’ll get a good price. It was fun today. While tending to the flowers it started to rain. Mom called me back in, but I wouldn’t miss such an opportunity. In minutes I was soaked. And I could just let my bladder relax. It felt incredibly naughty to pee myself like that. I wish I could do it more often.

Rachel continued flipping the pages. As she read through the journal entries, a completely different side of Mark was beginning to present itself. The boy was beginning to get sexually active. She could definitely sense that. And strangely, pee played a major role in his life. From the readings, not only did Rachel notice his special interest, but she also could see how lonely he was. Holding so many emotions within him, it was not healthy.

It took Rachel a day or two to wrap her mind around what she had discovered. Pee was not new to her. Back in the days, she had friends who were into it. After thoroughly thinking through it, Rachel made her mind up to let Mark know that he was free to do what he pleased. It's pee after all, she thought. More importantly, she wanted Mark to be comfortable with his sexual interests. Not hide it.

Mark’s Birthday - From the outside, the house looked perfectly normal when Mark cycled back from college. At the entrance of their sunflower field, his mother’s truck was parked haphazardly. The pile of firewood he’d chopped earlier in the morning was still in the corner of the house, as Mark made a mental note of putting them in the shed before his mother complained.

Dusting off his muddy shoes on the grass, Mark walked up to the main door, and nudged it open. “Momâ€¦ I am homâ€¦”, and even before could complete his sentence, a unanimous cheer “Surprise!!!!!” Shrilled across the living room. In front of Mark stood his uncle Alan, aunt Ruby, his cousins Emma, along with Brook, and his mother right in the middle.

Mark noticed the wall in their living room decorated with balloons, and letters “Happy 18!”. Between them and Mark was the centre table, over which was a handmade chocolate cake with lit candles. “Happy birthday hunny” said Rachel, taking the lead, and hugging her son in a warm embrace.

“Tha…thanks mom” said Mark, and had to make sure that his displeasure was not entirely evident in front of his extended family or his mother. Yes, Mark was an introvert, but at the same time, he wasn’t an ass. He knew that his mother had to have planned all this quite a bit, and he respected the fact that his family members took time and travelled a distance to make his day.

“A few hours, and it will be done” he thought to himself, and dived right into it. The cake was cut, the annoying “Happy birthdayâ€¦” song was sung, gifts were handed over, and finally people started to settle down. As usual, beers were out, followed by a cheerful family dinner.

Initially it did feel a bit annoying, but Mark managed to have a good time during the course. His cousins were cool. They spoke about college, and caught up on life in general. While they did this, the adults were discussing their farms, dirty politics and his uncle was explaining how cool the equipment was that he had recently purchased.

After about 3 hours or so, when the sky outside turned a shade orange, it was time for people to start leaving. Seeing the last car vanish across the horizon, Rachel turned to her son “Did you like it?” She asked. “Yeah, I kind of did” responded the boy in his usual tone of uncertainty.

“Come on now, it’s time for another surprise” said Mary, and almost immediately Mark spoke up “Mom, kind of had enough with surprises todayâ€¦”, he said, which was casually turned down by his mother as she walked in.

“Now that you’re 18, and for being such a good boy all through your teenage years, I feel it’s the right time for us to share a drink” she said, holding a pack of six. “Mark, your dad would have been so proud of you. He always told me how he’d envisioned your 18th birthday” she uttered softly, tearing up slightly.

Mark immediately walked closer and hugged Rachel. When it came to his late father, both of them supported each other emotionally. This is how Mark and his mother coped with his loss. “Anyways, can you start the fire outside, I’ll gather some munchies and beers” said Rachel.

Mark didn’t object. And got to the task right away. Beer was new to him. His peers back in college often boasted about their drinking, and parties. But this never really excited Mark. He remained quiet and overheard them talk. Now that his mother suggested this, there really wasn’t a problem.

The crackling of firewood surfaced, as the flickering orange flames enveloped the pit. Mark placed two easy chairs beside each other, along with a table in between. It took a few minutes for Rachel to arrive with the beers and chips. The two sat down, overlooking their field of sunflowers, across the horizon was the setting sun.

“It tastes weird” said Mark, as he sipped his first beer. “Kind of an acquired taste, love, drink a can, and then take a call” responded Mary, sipping hers comfortably. Mark decided to take it slow, he took a larger sip, and placed the can on the table. “Markieâ€¦ I wanted to talk about something with you” said Rachel. Mark readjusted his posture in such a way that he was now looking at his mother. “Look, I don’t mean to pry, I was just being concerned alright. You don’t have friends, and you don’t tell me what’s happening in your life. I know you are doing well in college, and I also know you prefer your own company, but I am just concernedâ€¦” she said.

“I am alright mom, really” he assured her. Mark never really opened up, and he felt okay being that. “I know I knowâ€¦ see Markie, each of us are different, you are unique in your own ways, I respect that. But yesterday, while cleaning your room, I couldn’t help but stumble upon your personal diary”.

Mark, who was mostly relaxed, quiet and calm, had this sudden change. His heart beat started to pace up, his face showed strong signs of shock, and he immediately sat up forward, looking at his mother in disbelief. He just couldn’t believe that he’d forgotten to put the book away after penning down his last entry. The book was specifically written to express his kinky interests, and nothing more. The sole purpose of the book was that. In which, he’d written about his fantasies, his experiences and desires.

“Mom, that book is supposed to be personal” said Mark, sounding defeated and angry at the same time. Before he could say anything more, Rachel interrupted him. “Sweetie, it’s alright. I am not mad, and I am not judging you”. Mark was definitely caught off guard. He just couldn’t find words to communicate further. His mind shut off, and his chest felt heavy. His last entry was fresh in his mind. He’d written about how exciting it was to leak pee into his knicker around his mother. He’d expressed nothing sexual about his mother. All he had written was the naughtiness he felt when he peed his underwear little by little while talking to her, while doing the chores around her, and finally letting go.

“Mark, trust me when I say this, it’s okay. Pee hurts absolutely no one. Yes, cleaning is a pain when you go in your clothes, but that’s something we can live with” she explained. Mark was now sniffing, as tears rolled down his cheeks. He felt embarrassed, and all he wanted to do was run away.

Rachel got off her chair, and hugged her son. They remained quiet for almost a minute. “Mom, I won’t do it ever again, I promise” he uttered, feeling extremely guilty. “Grab your beer, and walk with me” said Rachel, leading the way, walking into the farm. Reluctantly, the boy followed her, having not much of a choice.

“Mark, drink your beer when it's cold, it’s better that way” she said. “Mom! I don’t give a fuck about the beer!” Retorted Mark, crying openly now. “Language, mister! Turning 18 doesn’t give you permission to swear!” She said, sounding angry.

Confused, anxious and embarrassed, Mark decided to just do what he was told. Quietly, he gulped a few large sips of his beer, which strangely felt a lot more comforting. By now, Rachel had walked a few feet away from him. Mark noticed her look ahead, and casually observed the sun setting. “Sweetie, let us start over again, but this time, I need you to keep an open mind, and try hearing me out. Can you do that for me?” She asked politely.

Mark by now had calmed down a bit, and had accepted the fact that his secret was out. “Okay” he said softly, standing beside her now. Rachel nonchalantly looked ahead, and spoke “Mickie, I don’t think you have an idea about this, but what you’ve written in your diary is not all that uncommon as you think”. By now Mike had realized that his mother was not upset or angry, and she was trying her best to communicate something. “What do you mean by that mom?” He asked, for the first time, attempting to even make a conversation regarding his interest.

“What I mean to say is, people enjoy doing that. I have friends who do it on a regular basis, and when we meet, they open up and spill out a few details” she explained, turning towards Mike now”. Maintaining a comfortable gaze, she said “The problem is not peeing your pants sonâ€¦ the problem is making a big deal of it in your head. The problem is keeping things a secret. By constantly doing that, you will develop unhealthy sexual behaviours. And given your private nature, frustration in that area will creep in” she added.

Mark listened to her with rapt attention. Her words felt soothing, and for the first time, he felt someone actually understood him. His eyes by now had dried off, and the sweet effects of the beer was starting to calm his nerves further. “As a mother, I don’t want that, okay? I want you to be accepting of your interests. Sexual and non sexual both. So, if you like wetting yourself, or peeing in places you shouldn’t, I suggest you go for it. But make sure you clean up afterâ€¦ okay?”

“Did she actually give me permission to pee myself!” Was the thought that rushed into Mark’s mind. In his wildest dreams, he never had imagined such a situation. Strangely, the beer had made its way to his bladder. Also, given that it was his first, he was feeling pretty buzzed. “You’re awfully silent there Markieâ€¦ isn’t this something that you wanted?” Asked Rachel.

“Yeah, I guess” responded Mark. “It’s just that, I never expected to be having this conversation with you” he added. “Well Markie, lately, it’s been really difficult to have any kind of a conversation with you. Ever since Bella left, you’ve gotten so silent. I miss talking to you, you know” she said, finishing her beer.

By now, the sun had set. The natural light was beginning to diminish rapidly. “Let’s head back home huh, it’s been a long day” suggested Rachel. The two started walking back home, and Mike quietly pondered upon the recent past. Like him, his mother too didn’t have many people to talk to. Since his best friend leaving, he had been avoiding conversations with her. This made Mark feel a little bad. However, a surge of excitement was starting to build inside him. His mother had just allowed him to pee where he wanted “I can’t believe she knows about this!!!” He thought, unable to comprehend this situation.

They were just about to enter the house when Rachel stopped. She stood on the porch and turned around to face her son. “I know your nature Markie, you will end up overthinking the shit out of this, and it will take you days or weeks again to make any progress” she said. “So let’s break the ice, I know you are one beer down, which means you have to pee”.

“What are you trying to say mom?” Asked Mark, feeling very anxious. He knew her tone, and kind of had an idea where this was heading too. “You know exactly what I mean son” she said, smiling casually. “We do this once, I want you to stand right where you are and relax” she instructed. “I can’t do that, no mom!” He fought back. By now, Mark was reaching his limits, he really needed a pee, and this situation was only making it worse. “Sweetie, you know I don’t take no for an answerâ€¦ and I don’t want to make this a big deal. Deep down, this is exactly what you want, stop resisting and go for it. And for god sake, it’s not drugs or crap like that, it’s just pee! I can live with that, so now do it” she almost ordered.

Mark’s mind kind of shut off. There was nothing to hide anymore. He wasn’t dreaming. This was real. He looked into his mother’s eyes, and blushed “I am kind of shy” he muttered. “I am sure you’ll be fine, this ain’t the first time I’ll be seeing you wet yourself” chuckled Rachel, keeping things light. “Mooomm!” Blushed Mark deeper. For a few seconds, there were no words that were exchanged. Mark stood there, breathing heavy, as the warm feeling spread across his crotch. His muscles retracted involuntarily, cutting off the flow. Years of training were kicking in strongly.

Rachel knew what was happening. She couldn’t see any traces of wetness, but knew Mike was in the process. “Go for it champ, it’s alright” she almost encouraged him playfully. Mark closed his eyes, and consciously relaxed his body. In seconds, his desperation got the best of him, leading to a complete flood inside his jeans. Pee shot out from the confines of his underwear, leaving trails all the way down. A puddle started to form around his feet, as he sighed in relief.

Rachel was happy to see her son finally give in. If letting him pee his clothes was the way forward, that’s the way it will be, she thought. “See, not all that difficult right?” She said, breaking the silence. Mark opened his eyes, and almost teared up. “Thank youâ€¦” he whispered, peeing himself thoroughly. “Sweetie, no matter what, or how old you become, you will always be my baby. And I’ll be your best friend, forever. Don’t you ever forget that, okay” said Rachel, getting slightly emotional herself. “Now, you take a moment, and when you feel it’s time, come in, and clean up. We’ll watch a movie” she winks, and walks into the house.
