So I will give you the background of me.

I I am a girl who likes Omorashi, hence why I'm here, so this won't be my last story on here. I was wearing some black panties and an oversized top.

So I was laying in bed and I kind of needed a wee, but I didn't want to move as I was watching Family Guy. As I was watching though I hear legit noises at the end on my bed and when I when to inspect I found a massive spider and it scuttled under the bed. I screamed and a spurt of pee released into my panties. I through my hands down to block my pee hole and I feel them warm up. I managed to stop.

I lay back down and felt constantly paranoid of where the spider had gone. Checking every few seconds and feeling like it was on me. Every time I felt like it was on me I would scream and pee a little more.

Finally I get up to go to the bathroom to change and I see it above the door. I freeze and stare at it, it slowly climbs down the wall and when I touches the floor I screamed and jumped backwards on to my bed, where I release the rest of my pee. I start to cry, I reach over to my draw and grab some new clothes and hit the spider with a shoe.

Thats all I've got for today, if you liked it or want something else added to then just say.
