I was inspired by this post && to write a story about an accident during platelet donation. It's been a while since I've shared my writing here. Hope y'all like it! Rachel stood in front of her mirror, tugging at the hem of her sweater as she debated whether she looked alright. She wasn’t dressing up for anything special – it was just a platelet donation – but she still wanted to feel put together.

She had settled on a soft cream-colored sweater that hung loosely over a pair of snug, light-wash jeans. The jeans hugged her legs, high-waisted and slightly stiff from the last wash. They covered a pair of pink cotton day of the week panties that Rachel made sure matched the proper day. Maybe leggings would have been more comfortable, but she liked how the jeans looked, and besides, she wouldn’t be moving around much anyway. She slid her feet into a pair of white sneakers and gave herself one last glance.

Her phone buzzed with the appointment reminder. Forty-five minutes. Her stomach fluttered, a mix of nerves and anticipation.

She had given whole blood before, once or twice, but this was her first time donating platelets. The nurse on the phone had explained that the process was longer – nearly two hours, hooked up to a machine that filtered out platelets and returned the rest of her blood. She had nodded along at the time, but now, standing in her bedroom, the reality of sitting still for that long with a needle in her arm made her uneasy.

Rachel shook off the thought and headed to the kitchen, grabbing a water bottle from the fridge. They had told her to stay hydrated, so she took a long sip before peeling a banana and eating it quickly. She wasn’t hungry, but she knew she needed something in her stomach.

She checked the time again. If she left now, she’d be there early, but waiting at the clinic was probably better than pacing around her apartment.

The SkyTrain ride was short, the streets familiar, but Rachel’s fingers still tapped against her leg as the waited for the correct stop. Maybe it was the commitment that made her nervous. With whole blood, it was over in ten minutes. If she started feeling weird, she could just power through. But this? Two hours was a long time to sit there, unable to just stand up and leave if something felt off.

She took another sip of water at a station, trying to calm herself. She’d be fine.

When she eventually arrived at the clinic a few other donors were heading inside. Some looked relaxed, chatting as they walked, while others moved with the same quiet purpose Rachel felt.

Inside, the waiting room was clean and bright, the air smelling faintly of antiseptic and coffee. A couple of people sat in plush chairs, scrolling on their phones or sipping juice. Rachel approached the check-in desk, where a friendly nurse in blue scrubs smiled at her.

“Hi! Here for a platelet donation?”

“Yeah. Rachel K.”

The nurse typed her name into the system and nodded. “Got you right here. Do you need to use the restroom before we start?”

Rachel hesitated. She had gone before leaving home, she always did, and she didn’t feel like she needed to go now. Besides, she didn’t want to waste time.

“I’m good,” she said.

“Alright, come on back. We’ll do a quick health screening before we set you up.”

Rachel followed the nurse down a hallway lined with posters about blood donation. Some had smiling patients with thank-you messages, while others showed the different types of donations –whole blood, plasma, and platelets – along with how each one helped. She tried to focus on them rather than the jittery energy settling in her stomach.

They entered a small exam room where another nurse, a middle-aged woman with glasses perched on her nose, greeted her with a warm smile.

“Alright, Rachel, before we start, we need to go through the usual screening questions, check your vitals, and do a quick finger stick to check your platelet count,” she explained, pulling up a rolling stool and logging into a tablet.

Rachel nodded, rubbing her palms against her thighs.

“First, have you donated blood or platelets before?”

“I’ve donated whole blood twice, but never platelets.”

“Good to know. Any recent illnesses, fevers, or infections?”

“No.”

“Any new medications since your last donation?”

Rachel shook her head as the nurse continued down the list, asking about travel history, recent dental work, and any conditions that might affect blood donation. She answered each question, her nerves subsiding slightly as the process moved along.

“Great. Now let’s check your vitals.”

The nurse wrapped a blood pressure cuff around Rachel’s upper arm and pressed a stethoscope against the inside of her elbow. Rachel inhaled deeply as the cuff tightened, then relaxed when it released with a slow hiss.

“120 over 78 – perfect,” the nurse said. “Now, let’s check your iron and platelet count.”

Rachel instinctively offered her left hand as the nurse wiped the tip of her middle finger with an alcohol pad. The coolness made her shiver slightly.

“This will be a quick poke,” the nurse warned. A tiny lancet clicked, and Rachel felt a sharp pinch. A small bead of blood welled up, which the nurse collected onto a test strip.

Rachel glanced at the tiny droplet still on her fingertip. It wasn’t much blood at all, but knowing she’d be losing a lot more soon made her stomach tighten.

The nurse inserted the strip into a small handheld machine, watching as it processed the results.

“Your hemoglobin looks great, and your platelet count is high enough for donation. You’re good to go.”

Rachel exhaled slowly. She had been nervous about getting turned away for low iron, but everything was fine.

“Okay, let’s head to the donation area,” the nurse said, leading her into a large room filled with cushioned reclining chairs. Several donors were already set up, tubes running from their arms to humming machines. Some scrolled on their phones, others watched a mounted TV playing a cooking show.

The nurse gestured to an open chair near the window. “Go ahead and get comfortable.”

Rachel sat down and adjusted her position, the cool leather pressing against her back. Her jeans felt snug as she shifted, crossing and uncrossing her ankles.

Another nurse, a younger man with short brown hair, approached her chair with a friendly smile. His nametag read Ben.

“Hey, Rachel. First time donating platelets?”

“Yeah,” she admitted. “I’m a little nervous.”

“That’s totally normal,” he assured her. “I’ll walk you through everything, and if you ever feel off, just let me know, okay?”

She nodded as he wheeled over a small tray with supplies.

“Let’s find a good vein.”

Ben tied a blue tourniquet snugly around Rachel’s right arm, just above her elbow. She made a fist as he palpated the inside of her arm, pressing lightly until he found a vein he liked.

“Nice one right here,” he said, swabbing the area thoroughly with an alcohol pad. The strong antiseptic scent made Rachel wrinkle her nose.

“Alright, small pinch.”

Rachel watched as he inserted the needle in one smooth motion. The sharp prick made her flinch slightly, but it wasn’t bad. A thin, flexible tube extended from the needle to the apheresis machine beside her.

“Okay, here’s how it works,” Ben explained. “This machine will draw out your blood, separate the platelets, and return everything else to you. It’ll cycle a few times over the next hour and a half. You might feel a little cold from the anticoagulant we use, but I’ve got blankets if you need one.”

Rachel nodded, gripping the armrest lightly. The machine hummed to life, and she watched as her blood traveled through the tube.

At first, the donation felt surprisingly easy. Rachel settled into the reclined chair, her arm resting on a cushioned support while the machine steadily drew her blood, separated the platelets, and returned the rest to her body.

She kept her eyes on her phone, scrolling through social media to distract herself. Occasionally, Ben checked in on her, asking how she was feeling.

“All good,” she answered, forcing a small smile.

After about fifteen minutes, though, Rachel started to feel… different. It wasn’t pain, exactly – more like a creeping unease in her body. The machine made a soft clicking sound as it switched between drawing and returning blood. Each time it returned her blood, a slight chill ran through her, making her shiver.

She glanced at the IV in her arm. The tube was still dark with her blood, but she felt oddly disconnected from it, as though something was subtly off inside her.

“You doing okay?” Ben’s voice broke through her thoughts.

“Yeah,” she said automatically, then hesitated. “I do feel a little cold, though.”

“That’s normal. It’s the anticoagulant in the return cycle. Do you want a blanket?”

Rachel nodded, and within seconds, a soft, heated blanket was draped over her lap. The warmth was soothing, and she let her body relax into it.

Time crawled by. Rachel shifted slightly in her chair, trying to get comfortable. Her light-wash jeans, which had felt snug but fine earlier, now felt restrictive, as if her legs were swelling slightly against the fabric.

She was beginning to feel lightheaded.

Not bad, just… distant.

She took a slow breath, then another. Maybe she just needed to focus on something else. She unlocked her phone again, but her fingers felt clumsier than before. Her vision wavered for a split second, like a camera struggling to focus.

Then, nausea. Sudden, rolling nausea that tightened in her gut.

Her chest felt heavy, like it took more effort than usual to inhale. Her heart, which had been steady before, now thumped uncomfortably, slow and sluggish one moment, then too fast the next.

Something was wrong.

She swallowed hard and tried to sit up a little, but the movement made her dizziness worsen.

“Ben?” Her voice came out softer than she intended.

The nurse was at her side in seconds. “What’s going on?”

“I… I don’t feel right.” Her own voice sounded distant, disconnected.

Ben’s face sharpened with concern. “Alright, let’s get you lying back.”

He pressed a button on the chair, lowering it further. Rachel barely registered the movement as a wave of cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her vision darkened at the edges.

Her ears rang.

Her limbs felt unbearably heavy.

Then, she was gone.

When Rachel’s awareness returned, it was in pieces. Voices murmured around her, and something cool pressed against her forehead.

“She’s coming around.”

Rachel blinked, her vision slowly sharpening. The nausea still coiled in her stomach, but the dizziness had begun to ebb.

“Rachel? You had a vasovagal reaction,” Ben said gently. “You fainted for a few seconds, but you’re okay.”

She groaned softly, her body still uncooperative. Then…

The realization hit her like a shock of ice water.

Something was wrong. Not just her dizziness.

Something warm.

Something wet.

A horrible, sinking sensation bloomed in her stomach. Her legs, still snug in her light-wash jeans, felt damp.

No. No, no, no.

Her breathing quickened as the horror dawned fully. She had wet herself. Right there, in the donation chair. In front of Nurse Ben and the other people giving donations.

Her hands twitched toward her lap, but she was too afraid to check. The heated blanket still covered her, but she could feel the unmistakable dampness spreading beneath her thighs, clinging to her jeans.

Rachel squeezed her eyes shut, willing herself to wake up from some awful dream, but when she opened them, nothing had changed.

Ben must have noticed her shift in expression because he lowered his voice. “Hey, it’s okay. I promise, this happens sometimes when someone has a strong reaction. A lot of people pass out. Just give it a few minutes and I’ll get you some juice. Anything else I can get you?”

Rachel’s face burned. She realized that the blanket covering her lap had concealed her accident, and she wasn’t sure what to do next.

“Um… I…” Rachel thought hard, and tried to form words that wouldn’t add to her humiliation. She paused. She swallowed against the lump in her throat. “I—” Her voice cracked, and she shook her head.

“Take your time, I’ll get you that juice and be right back. Please remain laying down,” said Ben.

No matter how reassuring he sounded, no matter how clinical and professional he tried to be, there was no undoing the fact that she had passed out and lost control of her bladder like a child. The wetness between her legs remained warm thanks to the heated blanket, but her bum was beginning to feel cold and clammy.

Rachel kept her breathing slow and steady, trying to fight the burning humiliation creeping up her throat. She wanted to disappear, to sink into the donation chair and never come back.

Ben returned a few seconds later holding a glass of juice and a tray of cookies. “Let’s take this one step at a time. Do you feel lightheaded at all?”

Rachel swallowed and forced herself to assess her body. The dizziness had faded somewhat, but the nausea still clung to her stomach like a weight. “A little. But it’s better.”

“Good. Do you think you can sip some juice for me?”

She nodded numbly, and Ben reached over to grab a juice box from a nearby table. He poked the straw through the foil and handed it to her. Rachel’s hands still felt shaky, but she managed to take a small sip. The sugary liquid was too sweet, but she forced herself to keep drinking.

As she drank, her awareness of the wetness beneath her grew sharper. The damp fabric clung uncomfortably to her thighs, and she could feel the heat fading, replaced by an awful sticky chill. The blanket covered her lap, but she knew it wouldn’t hide the evidence forever.

She glanced at Ben, but his expression remained carefully neutral – professional. Did he know? Of course, he did. How could he not? There must be a puddle underneath where she was laying. But he hadn’t said anything yet, and the thought of telling him about her accident was mortifying.

Rachel’s stomach churned again. She couldn’t sit here like this. Did she hear a faint dripping sounds over the buzz of the room?

“I… I think I should go clean up,” she murmured, barely above a whisper.

“Cleaned up?” asked the nurse, a little confused. But then Rachel got to watch the realization spread across his face in real time. She watched him as his eyes moved down to her lap and then glanced beside her chair. “Oh, of course. I didn’t notice that you’d wet yourself.”

Rachel’s face burned with these words, and she looked away.

“Don’t worry at all. It happens to some people, incontinence sometimes occurs with people having a vasovagal reaction. Let me help you up slowly, okay?”

Rachel braced herself as he lowered the footrest and moved the IV stand out of the way. Her body still felt weak, her limbs sluggish, but she was determined to get out of the chair.

She gripped the armrests and pushed herself upright. The moment she moved, she felt it. The wet denim clung tighter, the unmistakable squish making her stomach drop.

The blanket on her lap shifted and fell to the floor, revealing the full extent of her accident. A dark wet stain had spread across her lap running from the pockets of her jeans and covering the inner parts of the jeans between her thighs. It glistened in the clinical light.

Ben must have noticed the way her face paled because he stepped closer. “Easy, Rachel.”

She didn’t meet his eyes. She couldn’t. She knew he could see the massive wet spot spread across her lap.

“Let me grab you a fresh blanket,” he said gently. “You can wrap it around your waist before heading to the restroom.”

Rachel barely managed to nod.

Ben moved quickly, retrieving another blanket and draping it over her shoulders before helping her wrap it securely around her waist. The gesture was discreet, but she still felt unbearably exposed.

“Bathroom’s just down the hall,” he said. “Take your time, and if you still feel off, let me know.”

Rachel forced herself to move. The damp denim rubbed against her skin with every step, but at least the blanket shielded her from view.

The hallway felt impossibly long, but she finally reached the restroom. She slipped inside, locked the door, and pressed her back against it, squeezing her eyes shut.

Her breath came in shallow gasps.

She had wet herself. In public. In front of a nurse.

A part of her wanted to cry, but she forced herself to focus. She needed to clean up and get out of here.

Peeling off the wet jeans was miserable. The fabric clung to her skin, and she winced at the chill. Her pink panties were soaked.

Rachel grabbed a handful of paper towels, dabbing at her skin as best she could before tossing them into the trash. She looked at herself in the mirror, cheeks flushed, eyes still slightly dazed.

Her jeans were a lost cause. The light fabric had darkened in a mortifyingly obvious pattern. There was no way she could walk back through the clinic like this.

A knock at the door startled her.

“Rachel?” Ben’s voice was quiet. “I have some spare scrubs if you need them.”

Tears burned at the back of her eyes. He had thought ahead. He knew she wouldn’t be able to leave in her jeans.

She swallowed past the lump in her throat. “Y-yeah. Thanks.”

She moved to the door, conscious of being completely naked from the waist down. The unlocked the door and opened it a crack, being careful to remain behind the door. Nurse Ben had already seen her pee herself, she didn’t need to flash him as well. Through the crack he handed her a plastic bag and a folded pair of navy blue scrub pants.

Rachel quickly pulled them on. The fabric was loose and soft, a mercy compared to her damp jeans. She bundled her wet clothes into the plastic bag. Despite the fact that she was wearing bottoms, she felt vulnerable and exposed without panties. She composed herself, took one last deep breath, and unlocked the door.

Ben was waiting just outside.

“You okay?” His voice was still gentle, still professional, but there was no judgment in his face.

Rachel hesitated, then nodded.

“Let’s get you something to eat before you head out, okay?”

She wanted to argue, to say she just wanted to leave, but she knew she needed the recovery time.

And maybe… maybe she wasn’t ready to face the outside world just yet.

Rachel followed Ben back to the donor recovery area, keeping her head down. The fresh scrub pants felt foreign on her legs – too loose, too unfamiliar – but at least they were dry. She clutched the plastic bag with her soaked jeans inside, her grip tight. The shame still sat heavy in her stomach, but there was nothing she could do now except get through the next few minutes.

They passed the chair where’d she’d been giving her donation and she could see that a yellow A-frame ‘Wet Floor’ sign had been placed next to the bed. Her cheeks burned and she looked away.

The recovery area was quiet, just a few other donors sitting at small tables with juice and snacks. Rachel hesitated, her body still feeling sluggish, but Ben gestured toward an empty chair.

“Take a seat. I’ll grab you something to eat.”

She nodded, lowering herself onto the chair carefully. The dizziness had mostly faded, but she still felt weak, like she’d run a marathon she hadn’t trained for.

A moment later, Ben set a small plate of crackers and a banana in front of her, along with another juice box. “Try to eat a little. It’ll help.”

Rachel picked up a cracker, nibbling at the edge without much appetite.

Ben sat across from her, not saying anything for a moment. Then, he spoke, his tone casual. “You’re not the first person this has happened to, you know.”

Rachel’s stomach clenched. “I… ” She swallowed, barely able to meet his gaze. “I’ve never fainted before. Or…” She hesitated, her face burning, before she forced herself to finish. “Or had an… accident.”

Ben nodded, not looking the least bit surprised. “Vasovagal reactions can hit people hard, especially during platelet donations. The longer donation time increases the chances of a reaction. It’s not about toughness or anything like that – it’s just how your body responds.”

Rachel stared at her cracker, twisting it between her fingers. “It’s still embarrassing.”

“I get it,” Ben said gently. “But trust me, we don’t judge. And you handled it as well as anyone could.”

She let out a slow breath. He was being kind, but it was still hard to process the reality of what had happened. The humiliation still sat heavy in her chest, but at least Ben wasn’t making it worse.

She took another small bite, forcing herself to eat more. As she chewed, she glanced around, half-expecting the other donors to be staring at her, whispering.

But no one was paying her any attention.

Maybe they hadn’t noticed. Or maybe they just didn’t care.

After a few more bites, Rachel sighed. “How long should I stay?”

“Give it ten more minutes, and if you’re feeling steady, you’ll be good to go,” Ben said. “You should take it easy for the rest of the day. No heavy lifting, no intense exercise. And make sure to drink plenty of fluids.”

Rachel nodded, reaching for the juice box. “Got it.”

They sat in silence for a moment. Then, Ben smiled slightly. “So, do you think you’ll ever try donating again?”

Rachel let out a weak laugh. “Maybe… but not anytime soon.”

“That’s fair,” Ben said. “But if you ever do, just know we’ll be happy to have you back.”

She wasn’t sure if she would, but hearing him say it made her feel a little less awful about the whole experience.

Ten minutes later, Rachel finally stood up, testing her balance. She still felt drained, but at least she wasn’t dizzy anymore.

Ben walked her to the exit, holding the door open. “Take care, Rachel. And don’t be too hard on yourself, okay?”

She met his gaze for the first time since the accident and managed a small smile. “Thanks, Ben. For everything.”

Rachel took a deep breath as she stepped out onto the street and headed towards the nearest SkyTrain station. She found she was gripping the strap of her bag a little tighter than necessary. The platelet donation clinic looked exactly the same as it had months ago – large glass windows reflecting the pale winter sky, the automatic doors sliding open with a soft whoosh. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and something sweet, like the apple juice they always handed out afterward.

Her stomach twisted with nerves, but she squared her shoulders and forced herself to walk forward.

###

Another Donation?

After what happened last time, she had been convinced she would never set foot in the donation centre again. The memory of waking up in the donation chair, dazed and drenched in humiliation, still haunted her. The cold, clammy feeling of wet denim clinging to her skin. The way Ben had gently handed her a pair of spare scrubs, pretending not to notice how red her face had been. The plastic bag containing her soaked jeans and panties stuffed into her purse. The self-conscious feelings of taking public transit in a borrowed pair of scrubs without panties…

She had wanted to pretend none of it had ever happened.

But the thought nagged at her.

The idea that she had failed. That she had let one bad experience scare her away from something good. And she also knew that they preferred if people could donate multiple times. So a couple of months later, there she was again, heading off to an appointment to give another donation.

This time, she had prepared. She drank extra water the night before and all morning. She had eaten a full meal – oatmeal and a banana, plus some yogurt – so her blood sugar would be steady. She even packed a change of clothes, just in case (a pair of leggings and a change of panties were neatly folded in the bottom of her purse. She’d chosen a black pair of jeans and another baggy sweater.

It won’t happen again, she told herself. I know what to expect this time.

The waiting area was quiet, just a few other donors flipping through magazines. Rachel approached the check-in desk, where a woman in navy scrubs greeted her with a polite smile.

“Hi, welcome back! Name?”

“Rachel K.,” she said, trying to keep her voice steady.

The woman nodded and typed into the computer. “Ah, I see you’ve donated here before. Thanks for coming back!”

Rachel forced a smile. “Yeah. Happy to.”

The receptionist scanned the screen, then paused. Her expression shifted, just a flicker of something unreadable before she looked back up. “One moment, Rachel. Let me just get a nurse to go over something with you.”

Rachel frowned. “Oh. Okay.”

The woman stood and disappeared through a side door, leaving Rachel standing there, her nerves suddenly returning tenfold.

She glanced around. The other donors weren’t paying attention. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

But something felt… off.

After a minute, the door swung open again, and a different nurse stepped out – a woman in her forties with a warm but professional expression. “Rachel? Hi, I’m Anna. Could you come with me for a moment?”

Rachel’s stomach dipped.

“Uh, sure.”

She followed Anna down a short hallway, past the donation room, to a small side office. Anna gestured for her to sit, and Rachel did, trying to ignore the sudden anxiety creeping into her chest.

The nurse sat across from her, glancing at a tablet. “So, Rachel, I see that you had a vasovagal reaction during your last donation.”

Rachel’s face burned. “Yeah.”

“That’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Anna said quickly. “It’s more common than you’d think, and I’m glad you’re willing to try again.”

Rachel let out a small breath. “Thanks. I, um, I made sure to eat and drink plenty this time.”

“That’s great,” Anna said with a nod. “But… because of what happened last time, there’s a note in your file. It’s a precautionary measure, just to make sure you’re comfortable in case something similar happens again.”

Rachel’s brow furrowed. “Okay…?”

Anna hesitated, then gave her a reassuring smile. “Before we begin, we’re going to have you change into a protective undergarment. Just in case.”

Rachel blinked. “A… what?”

Anna’s smile didn’t falter. “A disposable brief. It’s standard for donors who have experienced incontinence during a past reaction. It’s just to ensure your comfort in case it happens again.”

Rachel’s stomach plummeted.

“A diaper,” she said flatly.

Anna didn’t flinch. “A precaution.”

Rachel stared at her, heat rushing to her face. She had spent weeks convincing herself that what happened last time was a freak accident, a one-time humiliation. She had prepared for this. She had control this time.

And now they wanted her to put on a diaper like she was some child who couldn’t be trusted?

She swallowed, her throat suddenly dry.

Her hands tightened into fists in her lap.

Rachel’s heart pounded as she stared at Anna, who had stood up to retrieve something from the cupboard behind her.

She had spent months trying to move past what happened. She had prepared for today, convinced herself it wouldn’t happen again. She had been ready to prove – to herself – that she could do this.

And now they wanted her to wear a diaper.

She wanted to say no. She wanted to storm out of the office, to tell them she wasn’t a child, that she could handle herself. But she also remembered what had happened last time. Bringing a change of clothes was one thing, but if she passed out again and wet herself, she’d still have to change into those clothes, and everyone would see that she’d had an accident.

Anna returned to her desk, holding a white, square, folded diaper in her hands. “I know this might feel uncomfortable, but it’s just a precaution. No one will know but you. And it’s better to have it and not need it than the alternative.”

Rachel flushed, knowing exactly what she meant by ‘alternative.’ The memory of last time –coming to, soaked, humiliated – flashed through her mind.

Would it really be worse than that? She pressed her lips together, her stomach twisting.

Finally, she exhaled and muttered, “OK.”

Anna smiled gently. “I appreciate your understanding. I’ll show you to a private restroom where you can change.”

Rachel followed her down the hall, her entire body tense. She felt exposed, even though nothing had happened yet.

“The restroom is just over there,” Anna said, pointing. “Take your time. When you’re ready, we’ll proceed like normal.” She handed Rachel the diaper. Rachel barely looked at it as she took it, her face burning.

Rachel nodded stiffly, then hurried into the bathroom, locking the door behind her.

She leaned against the sink, squeezing her eyes shut.

With a resigned sigh, she turned and slowly unbuttoned her jeans and shimmied them down her legs. The pale blue panties she had picked that morning felt mocking now – like she had assumed too much, like she had believed she would be in control this time. She sighed and slipped them off, tucking them into the pocket of her purse before reluctantly unfolding the disposable diaper.

It was thicker than she expected, but plain – white, with soft, crinkly material, with lettering and stripes down the middle. It didn’t look like a baby’s diaper, at least. It was more like those adult incontinence products she had seen in commercials. That didn’t make it any less humiliating. She realized it was a pull-on variety, and she took some solace in the fact that it at least had this much in common with panties.

With stiff movements, she stepped into it, pulling it up snugly around her waist. The padding pressed against her in a way that felt wrong – foreign and intrusive. Her jeans were tight, and as she pulled them back on, she could feel the bulk between her legs. Was it noticeable? She turned in the mirror, checking from the back. Maybe a little.

She turned, inspecting her bottom. Maybe a little more that a little, she thought. She adjusted her jeans, but the bulk of the diaper was clearly visible, to her at least. She pulled her sweater down to cover herself as best she could.

Who would notice, she thought. Still, she knew. And that was bad enough.

Rachel ran her hands over her thighs, exhaling slowly. It was just for today. Just for the donation. No one would know. She took an exploratory step and felt the bulk of the diaper between her legs. She couldn’t quite keep them together. And now she was self-conscious of both the bulk under her jeans and her walk.

Reluctantly, she grabbed her bag, squared her shoulders, and left the bathroom.

Anna was waiting outside with a reassuring smile. “All set?”

Rachel nodded stiffly.

“Great. Let’s get you checked in and prepped for donation.”

As they walked toward the donation area, Rachel kept her steps small, hyperaware of every little movement. The crinkling was probably in her head, but it still made her heart pound. She felt like she was waddling.

After the routine check in questions, Rachel settled into a donation chair. Her body was still tense, the bulky undergarment between her legs making every shift in position feel awkward. She tried to focus on the procedure ahead of her, the steady hum of the machines, the soft murmur of voices in the background. It all seemed so familiar. She asked for a couple of extra blankets to cover up and keep warm and then things got underway.

"You're doing great," Anna said, checking the needle and adjusting the tubing.

Rachel nodded, trying to relax. She’d been careful. She had hydrated, eaten, and made sure to breathe slowly. Everything was in place. This time would be different.

The steady rhythm of the machine filled the room as blood began to flow into the collection bag. Rachel stared at the ceiling, forcing her body to remain calm. It was just like last time, only this time there would be no fainting, no wetting herself, no humiliation.

Minutes ticked by, and she felt herself start to drift, the sterile scent of the clinic and the low sound of the machine almost lulling her into a half-sleep. Her hands, resting on the armrests, had gone numb. She shifted slightly, attempting to refocus, to stay present.

But then…

It started again.

The dizziness.

At first, it was subtle – just a light-headedness, like when you stand up too fast. But then it grew. The room seemed to tilt, the walls pressing in on her, and she fought to keep her eyes open. Not again.

Her heart rate kicked up, her breath shallow, and she tried to steady herself, to hold on. She swallowed hard, but her mouth felt dry. The feeling in her stomach, the familiar nausea, started to build, and she clenched her jaw.

No. I can’t.

She squeezed her eyes shut, focusing on her breathing, trying to calm the rising panic in her chest. But it wasn’t working.

“Rachel?” Anna’s voice cut through the haze, sharp and urgent. “Are you feeling okay?”

Rachel’s stomach lurched. She couldn’t respond. She felt her pulse throbbing in her ears, the world narrowing. Her vision blurred at the edges, and everything began to spin.

Then it hit.

A warm, unwelcome pressure spread through her. She felt it before she could stop it – the wetness, the unmistakable sensation of losing control. Her heart lurched, and the world around her seemed to freeze.

She didn’t want to look down. Didn’t want to face what she already knew had happened. She could feel the dampness spreading, soaking into the padding.

“I… I’m sorry,” she whispered hoarsely, her voice shaking as the tears pricked at her eyes, before everything went black.

She wasn’t sure how long she was out, but when she came to, Anna was already there, her hand on Rachel’s arm, voice calm but urgent. “It’s okay. It’s okay, Rachel. Just stay with me, alright?”

The nurse adjusted the machine, pausing the donation, and Rachel felt the weight of her embarrassment press harder. She wanted to sink into the chair, disappear completely.

Anna quickly and efficiently removed the needle from her arm, placing a cotton ball and bandage over the spot. “Just relax, Rachel. It looks like you passed out again.”

Rachel couldn’t speak. The shame was unbearable. She had prepared for this, and yet here she was again, in the same spot, just as helpless.

The bulky diaper between her legs felt even bulkier, and it thwarted her feeble attempt to bring her legs together. She lay there and tried to work through the nausea. She still felt loopy and her first attempts to speak were unsuccessful.

“I’ll go grab you some juice and cookies,” said Anna, stepping away momentarily.

Rachel took the time to compose herself, but when Anna returned, she was still feeling faint.

“Here you go,” said Anna. “Is there anything else I can get you?”

“I… I,” stammered Rachel blearily. “I peed.”

“Oh, that’s OK dear,” said Anna. “I think we are both glad that we took precautions,” she added comfortingly. Rachel could hear the professionalism behind it. She wasn’t looking for sympathy.

Rachel nodded, her face flushed, but she couldn’t make herself move. Her body felt too heavy, her mind too clouded by the mortifying reality.

As Anna helped her sit up, she draped a blanket over Rachel’s lap, her face a mask of kindness. “Take your time. You’re safe here.”

Rachel wiped at her eyes, trying to regain control. But there was nothing she could do. Nothing except let the tears fall.

After a short period of time, Rachel managed to calm down. Her cheeks were still tear-stained, but she was at least calm enough to get up. Anna guided Rachel out of the donation chair, her movements gentle but purposeful. Rachel's legs felt weak, and she had to rely on Anna for support, her body still trembling with the aftermath of the reaction.

They walked slowly to the small recovery area where Rachel had been before, but this time, it felt different. The discreet waddle that she’d worried about on her trip over to the chair now felt obvious. The thick, swollen diaper between her legs prevented her from walking normally, and she just knew that it was obvious under her tight jeans.

Anna quietly helped her sit down at one of the recovery chairs. Rachel’s mind was spinning. She couldn't look anyone in the eye. She barely heard the nurse’s voice, calm and steady. “We’ll take care of everything for you, Rachel. Just sit tight for a few minutes. Once you are feeling better, you can get changed up, OK?”

The words felt distant. Her mind wasn’t in the recovery room anymore. It was back in the chair, back in that place of helplessness, back to the humiliation of having lost control in front of strangers, again.

Rachel squeezed her eyes shut, trying to push back the rising flood of tears. She had tried. She really had.

But Rachel didn’t feel like resting. She felt like running. Running out of the clinic, away from the pity she felt in her own heart, away from the embarrassment she could no longer hide.

She wiped her eyes and stood up, using the armrest for support. “I… I need to go,” she murmured, her voice shaky.

Anna’s face softened. “Did you want to use the washroom?”

“No, like go, I want to go home,” said Rachel, feeling like a child. Rachel lay there, conscious of the warm wetness of the diaper she was wearing. Her face burned.

“Rachel, I understand. But we need to make sure you are OK first. We can’t have you passing out on the street and hitting your head or worse. You’ve had a tough moment, and you don’t need to rush.”

Rachel nodded, unable to speak.

She lay there for another 20 minutes. Her cheeks cooled, along with the sogginess between her legs. After a short period of time, and a few cookies and a cup of juice, the nurse cleared her to get up and directed her to the washroom to change.

Rachel waddled along in the nurses wake and was relieved when she at last found herself alone in the washroom.

She took her time peeling down her jeans and blushed when she noticed the stained swollen gusset of the diaper she’d been asked to wear. It was thick between her legs. Her faced burned as she pulled it down. She tossed the offending garment into the trash and fished around in her purse to locate her panties.

At least it had done it’s job and shielded her pants. She padded herself dry with some paper towel, pulled on her panties, shimmied up her pants, and replaced her shoes. She took longer than usual to compose herself and fix her appearance in the mirror. She wasn’t ready to face the nurse but a tap on the door reminded her that others would likely need the washroom.

Rachel kept her eyes down as she exited the washroom, and dazedly nodded her way through some final questions with the check-out staff before at last she was able to leave.

The cold air outside hit her like a slap, sharp and brisk, and for a moment, it felt like the world had finally stopped spinning. She took a deep breath. Would this be the last time she donated?

Rachel! This was so sooo good! I can’t even imagine. I had a weird reaction one time to TB test and almost passed out. The feeling of cold sweats and nausea as your heart thumps away hopelessly and vision closes in on blackness is all too familiar. I couldn’t imagine realization of waking up wet.

I’m surprised that the diaper was adequate. 😂 Any hospital diaper I have ever seen looked like a cheap drugstore depends pullup that is completely overwhelmed in one wetting. I feel in that situation it would be my luck that even the diaper would fail me and double down the humiliation.

Thank you so much for sharing this! I’ve missed a good Rachel story😊

Aww thank you! And it's been a while since I've shared a story. Life's been a little too busy for me to find time to write much. Also, yes, hospital diapers tend to be trash!
