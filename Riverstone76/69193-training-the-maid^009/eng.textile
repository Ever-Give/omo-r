Chapter 10:

All day, Sunday, the little girl was called an eight year old, but the way they fussed with her touching her own clothes, even just to change into play clothes after church, it was like they were treating her like a three year old. They didn’t even let her play by herself in her room, but made her take her toys and stuff to the living room where they could watch her, and they put up her crayons and other marking things on her because she was too immature for them at the moment. She was only allowed her dollies and stuffies.

At story time for the night, Uncle had made the story especially tame as though she was too immature to hand a real fight in the story, and gave her special kissing magic, hugging magic, and glance cutesy magic to attack the monsters with.

This version of playing out a story was not really that much fun for her, but she knew that they were just making her suffer the full wrath of what it was to be like if she was treated like a toddler, and as her aunt had told her earlier that day, if she did this again, she would be treated like a toddler for a week.

Despite the story being much less engaging and almost a chore, or maybe because of it, Mariela found herself drifting off to sleep while only on her second bottle of cola. They always gave her cola at night, telling her the caffeine would help their little niece act like their little helpless niece.

Mariela woke up sometime before she had to be up, and she sighed and went to the bedroom door. She remembered the day before, the horrible events glued to her mind as she stood in front of the door. She looked down at the carpet, which was dry, but still, she remembered the exact spot where her nightmare of the day before had started. She would never ever do that again!

Shaking her head, she walked out into the hall, and decided to head down to the kitchen to wait for her aunt there. There was no point in going towards the bathroom. Her Uncle or Aunt would change her for school when she was ready, and she knew she wasn’t allowed to take off her diaper until it was removed for her.

The day before, though it was really tough on her, to teach her a lesson for being irresponsible earlier in the day, Mariela knew, it could have been a lot worse. As it was, she was forced to wear a pull up all day, and she had accidentally wet the pull up twice, well, not the same one. The other three times she had to go, she was taken to the potty in time. Her aunt warned her though, that if she made a habit of becoming like a toddler, that she might not be able to do meet her demands so regularly, so it was better if she tried to get to the potty like a good big kid.

Mariela nodded in agreement at her thinking back. Her aunt was right. It was better getting to the potty like a good big kid.

Her Aunt was actually already up, and was making breakfast. Uncle Steve was reading the newspaper at the table.

“Did you wet on purpose again?” her aunt asked her.

“No, Auntie.”

“You better not be lying. Steve check and see if she’s lying.”

“But, I didn’t…,” Mariela put her hands on her hips looking up at Susan.

“Mariela,” Steve looked at her sternly.

“What? I didn’t wet!”

“Then let your uncle check.”

“How he going to do that? You made me wet the bed last night,” she told them.

Both of the adults laughed at her when she said that.

“We made you?” Steve asked her looking her in the eye.

“Ye… yeah,” Mariela stumbled over her words as Steve looked into her eyes the glare making her feel like she was going to lose not only her nerve, but her morning flooding into her diaper.

Steve stood up.

Mariela looked down at her shoes, but she tried to keep her ground all the same. It was stupid that her aunt had punished her day before for wetting her pants just inside her room. They were going to make her pee her diaper anyway, and as of yet, her diaper was not yet, wet in, well, not since her nightly accident.

Steve reached over and made to swat her butt, but she moved just in time, and his hand sliced at the air.

“Mariela, you’re just making it worse for yourself, her uncle warned her. Get over here, or I’m going to spank!”

Wait! Didn’t he just try to swat her, though?

He reached out a second time, and this time, his hand caught her on the butt, and she nearly spun by the power of his slap to her thigh, and she fell to the floor, the stinging sharply shredding through her nerves to let her know that he had caught her, and that he meant business.

“Now, stand up, and get in my lap, right now, or you’ll really get it!”

Mariela felt some pee spray her diaper from the inside after a moment or two sitting on the floor, the sharpness still sending pain signals to her brain.

Timidly, she stood up and looked up at him, sorrow in her eyes.

“I’m… I’m wetting my pants,” she told them. “It’s cause… cause… it stings, and I had to go, and I can’t stop.”

She started crying.

“Check her and make sure she’s telling the truth,” Susan told him. “Her butt should be soggy and little warmer if she’s not lying.”

Steve nodded and as he lifted her up into his lap, he felt the back of her diaper closer to her thighs. She was wet, and it was starting to leak so that her pajama bottoms were also damp.

“Her pajamas are getting wet,” Steve announced to both of them.

“Now, see what you did?” Susan asked Mariela who raised her thumb to suck on to pacify her as she waited for her auntie to explain. “If you had just done what you were told, you would not have been spanked, and you might not have even gotten your pajama bottoms wet.”

Mariela started to sob around her thumb.

Auntie and Uncle Steve were the ones that were causing her pajamas to get wet, and the little wetness that Uncle had discovered moments before didn’t stop. It was spreading even as she sat in his lap. Soon, he would be discovering she was wetting right in his lap, and it was his and auntie’s fault for not letting her go to the toilet, even if she does wet the bed now.

It wasn’t long before he realized what she was doing, or what her body, rather, was doing to both of them, and getting him wet, and he lifted her up a bit by under the arms and checked under her and saw a drizzling line of pee pouring right through her pajama and down into his lap.

“This little kid just wet her pants on me,” Steve complained to Susan.

“Well, as you just said, she is a little kid. Take her to her room and get her dressed. I’ll have breakfast finished soon.”

Steve sighed and lifted the still leaking girl up and into his arms, and he carried her up the stairs.

“You know, it is one thing to have an accident, Mariela. An accident is not your fault, even if you are wetting all over my lap. But what you did yesterday, wetting your pants on purpose not even telling anyone you had to use the bathroom before letting it go all over yourself… that is very much like a baby. That’s why you were wearing pullups yesterday, and why we were checking you this morning….”

Mariela hung her head.

Uncle Steve put her on her bed.

“I’m not even that mad you peed on me,” he told her. “Because… I am hoping that was an accident.”

“It was,” Mariela tried to sniffle through her thumb.

“But I will not have you causing trouble on purpose. If you wet your pants at school, even once, and I find out you did it on purpose, your whole class will see you in a diaper. Do you understand me?”

Mariela nodded, shaking, afraid he was going to swat her again.

He turned to her dresser and started looking through her clothes.

“You were a very bad little girl, yesterday,” Uncle Steve told her. “And no, I don’t mean you were mischievous or even evil. I mean… you were a very unskilled child. You were just like a toddler, so we treated you like one.”

Mariela nodded.

“Now, you are going to be a good girl, come over and let me remove those wet pajamas, your soaked diaper, and then let me slip your clean panties on.”

“What about a bath?”

“You don’t have time for a bath. You peed all over your pajamas, so I also need to change and take a shower because you peed on me. The shower is going to be used, and if we both take one, you are going to be late for school, making the rest of us late for work.”

Mariela looked down. “Okay.”

Mariela was sure the punishment could have been a lot worse. They could have made her wear the wet diaper to school, but maybe they wouldn’t have. Still, they could have put her in a pullup, with the same rules as yesterday. She is not allowed to touch if she’s wearing a diaper or even a pullup. She had to go to an adult to ask permission to get help if she’s in a pullup, and if she’s in a diaper, she will just be ignored until she wets her pants…. AT least…, she is in a pair of green panties with little cartoons of ponies all over them.

The girl was put into a pair of pink jeans, and Steve put an undershirt on her, one that was sufficient to cover her very small chest, but still, it made her feel… well, not much like even a middle school kid. It made her feel like she was under ten years old again. And… he put her in a light blue and white horizontal broad band striped polo shirt.

“Now, go eat breakfast,” he told her, his hand catching only air as he swiped towards her bottom again to send her on her way. And just like he had said, he went directly to take a shower. She had peed on him, after all. What did she expect?

“Eat,” Susan told her sternly.

Mariela got a chill from the way that auntie told her to eat, so quietly, and yet so clearly. Would Auntie be mad if she back talked? She wasn’t about to find out.

Mariela felt dirty. She knew she had to smell. She was still stinking from not having a shower from wetting the bed, and then her morning pee, as always, going into her diaper, but she had gotten it on Uncle, so he needed a shower instead of her. She felt so dirty.

The car approached her school. She felt her head had a little water along the hairline. She was probably worrying too much, but then again, if anyone picked up that she smelled like she peed, last Friday’s incident would likely resurface so vividly in everyone’s mind, she would not be able to stand it for even half an hour. She trembled a bit as she stepped out of the car.

“Now, you be a good girl, and don’t you dare wet your pants on purpose,” her aunt told her before letting her walk towards the building. She hoped her aunts words had not been heard by anyone.

The poor girl nearly leapt from her skin when someone came up from behind her.

“Miss me?”

Mariela looked behind her, her thumb going right into her mouth at the sudden surprise.

“Oh,” Jenna frowned when Mariela put her thumb there. “You… you still do that, huh?”

Mariela started to ask what, but then because of it being in the way of her talking, she realized where her thumb was, and took it out of her mouth and wiped it on her shirt. “Um… you just surprised me,” she turned red. “I… I get nervous and I… I do that when I get nervous.”

“It’s not a big deal,” Jenna told her. “I bite my nails when I get nervous. Let’s get some cinnamon rolls. Want one?”

“I don’t have any money, Jenna.”

“So? I have enough for two, and you really need to taste these. They are the only decent breakfast item the school serves, and they are only made on Mondays.”

“Oh…,” Mariela looked down. “But I don’t even know if or when I can pay you back.”

“Now, now, friends don’t talk like that,” she said. “No one needs to pay anyone back for a little kindness. I scratch your back today, and if I need help with something tomorrow, then you scratch my back. You know?”

Mariela frowned. “Okay?”

Jenna didn’t let her raise anymore objections. Every time she went to open her mouth, all the way into the cafeteria, she put her finger on her lips and said, “Not one word.”

Mariela was nervous about everyone looking at her. Friday’s incident kept looming up to the fore of her mind, and she wondered how many people were seeing that incident, as they looked and saw her sitting there. She wondered how many people were talking about how dirty she was, or how much of a baby she was. She wondered how many people noticed that she smelled like pee, even now.

First period was nerve wracking. Uncle had not put a pad in her panties before school today. They were both preoccupied with how late she was making everyone. She noticed now. She hoped that her period was finished, but there was a chance, she would still leak some. It was only the fourth day.

Having been homeless for four months, she forgot what even worrying about having a pad was like. She forgot that it was embarrassing to not have one, in public, until she found herself here at school on Friday without one. And now, she knew she really should have one on just in case, but she had not put one on. What was she going to do?

Somehow, nothing happened though, or at least, nothing that anyone noticed.

Mariela didn’t even get teased about smelling like pee, and the more the day went on, the more confident that she was that no one remembered what happened no Friday, and that no one smelled her little morning problem. She would be in her auntie’s car soon, on her way back to their house. Maybe she could ask auntie to take an early bath.

Once Mariela was in the car, enclosed in a small space with just her and her aunt, she started to row down the window. She knew she smelled bad. She wondered how no one at school realized how much she smelled like pee.

“What are you doing?” Aunt Susan asked when she looked back and saw the girl rowing down the window.

“Um… I… I stink,” the little girl said with her head down. “I didn’t take a bath this morning, remember? Uncle got peed on, so he had to take a shower, so I couldn’t.”

Susan frowned.

“Are you sure you didn’t wet at school?”

“I promise, I didn’t Auntie. I just smell really bad because I peed this morning and didn’t get to take a bath. I promise.”

Susan sighed.

“Well, I hope you learned your lesson about peeing on purpose in your room or anywhere else.”

“I did. I promise.”

“I suppose we should have at least wiped you up or something. If you feel that icky, then auntie will give you a bath as soon as we get home, baby.”

“Thank you.”

“You’re sure your panties are not wet?”

“Um… not with pee. I promise.”

“What do you mean, not with pee, honey? What else would they be wet with?”

“Uncle forgot to put a pad on me this morning when he changed me. I… I think I have some… that stuff in my panties.”

Susan sighed. “Honey, you should have told me that uncle forgot. He’s not a girl, honey. He doesn’t know much about how long we need to wear those, and he doesn’t think about it unless you tell him or he sees an accident caused by it.”

Mariela just looked down.

“Did it get all over your pants again?”

“No. It’s just in my panties this time, I think.”

“Okay. Well, next time tell your uncle he needs to put one on you, or if you are embarrassed to ask him to do it, come and get me and tell me you need to have one on because uncle forgot.”

Mariela nodded.

Mariela was quite relieved to get a bath, and when her aunt saw her panties, she smiled at her niece and showed her that they weren’t even red anywhere, and that she worried for no reason.

And it seemed that for a few days, other than waking up wet every morning and having a morning accidental pee in her diaper when she ate breakfast, there were not anymore problems.

Then, it was Friday, after school.

Mariela was at her locker, putting her books away, and deciding what she’d need for the weekend to do her homework. That’s when Jenna came up and tapped her on the shoulder.

“Want to come with my mom and me shopping tomorrow?” she asked.

“Um… I’m not sure I’m allowed,” Mariela frowned. “I didn’t even get to ask my aunt.”

“Your aunt is picking you up from school like always, isn’t she?”

“Yeah….”

“How about I come and ask her with you? I’ll just tell her I just found out my mom was taking me tomorrow, and I thought I’d invite you because you’re the new girl at school, and I know you don’t have many friends yet.”

Mariela looked down. “Okay.”

“Mrs. Wayfeld?” the energetic slender black girl danced around waiting for the aunt to get out of the car to see what was going on.

“It’s just Miss or Ms.” Susan said. “I’m not married yet.”

“Oh, well, I just thought… Mariela always talks about her aunt and uncle, so I just thought….”

“That’s okay. So, what is it you wanted, honey?”

“Well, tomorrow, my mom and I are going shopping, and even after a week and a half, Mariela doesn’t really have any friends at school, so I thought it would be nice if she can come with my mom and me.”

“Well, I don’t know,” Susan frowned. “I really should talk to her uncle first about this. Do you have a phone number I can call you back after we make a decision?”

“Yeah, just a minute. Mariela doesn’t have a cell phone?”

“No. I didn’t think about getting her one yet.”

“Do you have one?”

Susan frowned. “It’s not for personal calls. I use my home phone for personal calls, honey.”

“Oh, okay, so… um… let me just pull up my phone number here….”

The girl got her phone all set up to her personal display information, an then she showed Aunt Susan.

“Wait a moment,” Susan said. “Mariela, do you have a place you can write this number down in your notebooks so you have the number, and so I can see it when we get home and then I can write it down where we will both have access to it?”

Mariela looked through her bag and pulled out her school booklet that had school rules on it, and she presented the back to her aunt. “We can use this,” she said.

“I’ll have Mariela call you tonight after we discuss it and give you an answer. How late can we call you on a Friday night?”

“Oh, my mom doesn’t care on Friday or Saturday. You can call me anytime you want.”

“That’s not good,” Susan mumbled. “Well, we’ll call you before nine, honey. If we haven’t decided before that, then we’ll try again tomorrow morning before nine.”

“Nine? Oh, okay.”

Susan sighed and she looked back at Mariela once they were on the way home.

“You want to go with your new friend?” she asked her.

Mariela looked down. “I’m… I’m not really twelve, Auntie. I’ll do whatever you want. I don’t need twelve year old friends.”

Susan frowned as she drove. She didn’t say anything for several blocks. Then she stopped at a light, turned to face Mariela, and she tightened her mouth.

“Honey, you need to pull off being twelve in every way you can, or the authorities will know something is off, whether you stay with Uncle Steve and me, or you get placed somewhere else. Do you want to end up back on the streets, only to find yourself in Mexico instead of the States at the same time?”

Mariela shook her head no.

“Then, you need to convince yourself that you are twelve years old. You need to make friends with kids of that age, or maybe your uncle and I should find a special school for special needs kids for you?”

Mariela frowned and looked down. “I’ll try.”

“I’ll talk to Steve about this tonight, and we’ll decide what is the best thing, but honey, if you go with this girl and her mom shopping, you are not to leave their side. You stay right next to them, and don’t let your friend drag you away from adult supervision. You need adult supervision to use the toilet at the mall.”

“I do?”

“Honey, you are not used to going potty in public places. That McDonalds person really scared you, not to mention you are not used to going potty in places besides school and our home because when you were on the streets, a lot of people would shoo ‘dirty people’ away, especially when you were not with your mom, so you either peed behind buildings where people might not see you, or you found places where you were not near anyone. If you didn’t, then you just peed your pants.”

Mariela looked down at her shoes.

“Okay, Auntie Susan. I won’t leave the mom’s side. I promise.”

“Good girl.”

Chapter 11:

“I don’t know,” Uncle Steve was saying when they picked him up from work and they started for home. “Mariela is barely used to us, and having her suddenly go on some shopping trip with a friend, what if she has a problem while she is out?”

Susan nodded. “She is supposed to be twelve years old. We don’t want people to talk, and people to think we mistreat her.”

“No, I guess you’re right about that,” he looked to the backseat at his little baby niece.

“Mariela, is your pants wet?” he asked her.

“No?” she pleaded remembering how they had been so insistent on checking her that Monday before school. “I didn’t. I promise.”

Steve turned back to Susan. “She’s not even, really, you know, trained the way I want her yet. It’s kind of early to start having her spend time with people outside of school.”

“Steve, is she supposed to just stay home all the time and just….”

“Just what?” Steve looked over at Susan, Susan was the one that was driving.

“Well, she’s supposed to be a little middle school girl. It’s not natural to keep her in the house all the time.”

“I don’t know, Susan,” and he looked back at the little twenty-three year old baby girl again. “Mariela, honey, you sure you’re not wet?”

Mariela looked down. She couldn’t tell if she was supposed to be wet or not, but she knew if she did it on purpose, she would definitely be in trouble. She started to wiggle her legs, to make sure Steve thought she was holding it. If she was going to have to wet her pants, it better be an accident. She knew that.

“I didn’t wet,” she told her weird Uncle Steve. “Honest.”

He nodded and turned back to the front.

Susan looked over at Steve, and Steve nodded at her, but Mariela wasn’t sure what that even meant.

Mariela kept wiggling her legs now, even though she really didn’t have to pee that badly. She was nervous that if she stopped wiggling, and if something didn’t go right, that she would be in trouble for wetting her pants. If something did happen, and if they thought she was wiggling for a while, maybe they wouldn’t accuse her of wetting on purpose.

Mariela put her thumb in her mouth.

Steve turned back and faced her.

“Mariela, your aunt is right. You probably should get out of the house more, but we need to talk about the rules if you are going to see your friend tomorrow.”

Mariela looked down. She would almost have preferred Steve to deny her permission to see her friend. She wasn’t sure how easy it would be to act twelve years old outside of school.

“Public potties are scary, aren’t they?” Steve asked her as they were still in the car, not too far from their house now.

Mariela looked down and nodded, not sure what he was going to tell her to do. Was this something about having her insist that someone go in with her when she goes potty?

“If you go out with your friend, shopping, I don’t know, how long do you think she’ll want to stay out shopping?”

Mariela shrugged.

“When I was a young girl,” Susan smiled, “I remember staying out for four or five hours.”

Steve frowned. “It’s not going to be easy for her to be out more than three hours, though, Susan. If she is, she might wet her pants.”

“Do you really think she’d wet her pants in front of her friend?”

“I don’t know,” Steve looked back at Mariela. “The little one has been on the streets for a long time, and she’s still not that comfortable around public toilets.”

“So, what are you saying Steve?”

“I’m saying that if the little one wets herself tomorrow, you shouldn’t get mad at her, even if it looks on purpose. Just let her do it….”

“But….”

“I don’t think it’s right to let her go out in public like that, and then get mad at her if she ends up wetting her pants. She’s still scared of public places, and she’s not going to know that mother that well either, so it’s not the same as you taking her potty.”

Susan frowned. “So, you want to give her permission, to just sit there and pee her pants, just like that?”

“Honey, I’m not saying that. She’s going to be really uncomfortable. It’s not going to be on purpose, Susan. She’s a scared little girl. She’s definitely going to wet her pants while she’s shopping, honey. It’s just a given. Unless you go with her and take her potty.”

Mariela frowned. She was starting to understand. Steve wanted her to wet her pants, in front of her friend and her friend’s mom. She shivered a bit at the thought.

“It’s either that, or she just doesn’t go tomorrow,” Steve told Susan. “She should not be going in public until she is comfortable anyway.”

“We can’t keep her cooped up in the house, Steve. Fine, let her just wet her pants, but I’ll put a pull up on her in the morning.”

“That’s a good idea. Let her wear a pull up and we’ll give the other girl’s mom a second pull up and explain to her that Mariela is still kind of scared of new places and people, and she is probably going to pee her pants.”

Steve then looked into Mariela’s eyes.

“I will not let Auntie Susan call it being on purpose, tomorrow baby. You have permission to just wet your pull up. I know you’re still scared to go potty in public places by yourself, and you don’t even know that other woman that well, that will be taking you and your friend shopping.”

“What if my friend finds out I wet my pants, though?” Mariela asked thinking that not only was she trying to get permission to not wet her pants, but also thinking even a regular twelve year old would be worried about it, too.

“Your friend is going to find out,” Steve told her. “That’s a given, baby. Just tell her you had an accident. If you want, we can talk with both the mom and the girl for a bit before they take you shopping, that way, they know what to expect.”

“But she’ll tell everyone at school that I pee my pants,” Mariela told him as Susan pulled the car into the driveway.

“Do you really think she’ll be that mean to you if we explain to her that you can’t help it? I honestly think if she is any kind of friend that cares about you, she’d help you rather than want to embarrass you at school.”

Mariela just looked down.

“We’ll discuss this some more later.”

Susan got out and headed for the door while Steve got out and went around to pick his little niece up and carry her.

“I gotta pee,” Mariela whispered to him.

“Honey, don’t let your auntie hear you say it like that. You’re not a little baby eight year old anymore. You can tell me you gotta go without spelling it out, sweetheart.”

“Sorry, Uncle.”

“I’m sorry, but I think your auntie is going there, first, so you’ll just have to wait, or if you are already wetting your diaper, just tell me.”

He felt her bottom anyway as he carried her.

Mariela blushed. She could tell he sort of wanted her to have an accident. She didn’t know why she knew that’s what he wanted, but maybe it was because he kept asking her if she was wet, and now, he was trying to feel her pants to see if she was wet at all.

She decided to purposefully accidentally leak a little bit against his hand as he was feeling for wetness.

Uncle Steve carried her to the living room, his hand still rubbing her bottom and he was whispering to her that she was a good little girl that never wets on purpose, but it’s okay if she wets on accident.

She sprayed on his hand a little bit, and when she thought it went enough to get his hand wet, she tried to turn it off, only it wouldn’t turn off. She kept peeing….

Mariela sniffled and brought her thumb to her mouth as she tried to close her legs but they were separated around Uncle’s body as he carried her. He felt her wet a little, she was sure of it. Then she wet more and more, and she was sure she was getting him wet, but he just rocked her as she continued to leak in her pants.

After what seemed like forever, the spraying that was turning itself on and off against her will, finally stopped, and she was soaked. She knew he had to be soaked, and there was not only a trail of dribbles from the dining area to the living room, but also a puddle where he had started to rock her. she was staring to cry around her thumb.

“Oh, baby. I knew you were trying to hold it in the car,” Steve told her. “It’s okay. It was just an accident, baby.”

Susan soon came out and saw her crying, and she looked at her wet niece, the drizzling trail to where Uncle was rocking her, and the lake under them, and she sighed shaking her head. Her niece had wet her pants. Mariela hoped she believed it was on accident.

“We need to clean her up anyway,” Susan told Steve. “I’m not really sure she had gotten all the way through school dry.”

“What do you mean?” Steve asked her.

“Well, there was no evidence that she had peed, but when she and her friend came up to ask me if she could go shopping with her family, I thought one of them smelled like they peed their pants. I hoped it was the other girl, but….”

Steve nodded. “That would be wishful thinking. Surely, not that many girls have the same developmental issues that our little Mariela has.”

“You’re right.”

Susan reached her hand up to Mariela’s back, and she patted her.

“Tell auntie the truth. Did you wet at school?”

“No?” Mariela pleaded. “Honest. I didn’t.”

“One of you smelled like you peed, honey. If it wasn’t you, then you are accusing your friend of wetting her pants. Did your friend wet her pants?”

“No,” Mariela frowned.

“Honey, it was either you or her….”

“Maybe it was me,” Mariela said. “But I didn’t feel it come out. Honest. I didn’t wet on purpose. Please, believe me. I’d never wet in front of everyone on purpose. And… I didn’t feel wet when I used the toilet at lunch time.”

“It’s okay,” Auntie said patting her back. “But we better give you a bath, okay?”

Mariela nodded.

Mariela was certain she had not peed at school though. She hoped her auntie was just making it up, playing games about what they expected from Mariela. She couldn’t imagine her friend peeing her pants.

Steve took Mariela to the bathroom, and he put her in the bath, and then sitting down to wash the poor little twenty-three year old, he spoke in a soothing voice.

“It’s okay, baby. We know it was an accident in the car,” he told her. “Or well, more like in the living room, really, huh? But we know you didn’t mean to. I know you were trying to hold it in the car, and I didn’t know you wet at school. I kept asking you because you smelled like you might have wet.”

Mariela’s face colored a little at that. She was sure her pants were dry when she came out to see her mom, and didn’t remember leaking at school at all. Maybe she did, and didn’t notice? Maybe?

“Anyway, sweetheart, we’ve decided to let you see your friend and go shopping with her, but I’m going to talk your aunt into letting you wear pullups and a pad in them while you are out. That way, if you are still scared of public potties, because of how mean people used to be to you about it, it won’t be your fault if you wet. You know the rule if you are wearing a diaper, don’t you?”

“I’m not going to take it off by myself, and I have to ask someone I trust that is older than a kid to help me with it.”

“That’s a good girl. We’ll tell the mother that you have issues and explain everything, so if you feel a little bit afraid of her looking at you, you can just come home wet, but if you want, I’ll let you let her help you if you need to change your pullup baby.”

Mariela nodded.

“No potty, though. You may as well just hold it until you get home or you wet your pants because I don’t see you wanting to use the public potty anyway, so there is no reason to put that kind of stress on you to try to force you.”

Mariela nodded.

“You’re a good little girl,” he rubbed her back.

Mariela settled in the bath and let her uncle wash her like he always did when she was upset at wetting her pants.

When Susan came into the bathroom after cleaning up the messes in the other rooms, Steve, still washing her back, turned his head towards her.

“I just gave her permission to go see her friend tomorrow,” he told Susan. “But we’re going to go ahead and put her in pull up because she’s still too nervous of public potties, and we don’t want to stress not only Mariela out, but also the girl’s mom that will be watching her.”

Susan nodded agreeing.

“Do you want to call Mariela’s friend?” he asked Susan.

“Well, I have to get her number from Mariela. Mariela wrote it down on one of her school things in her bag.”

“Well, you can just dig it….”

“No,” Susan told him. “I don’t want Mariela just digging through my things unless I give her permission, and the way we teach her to respect other people’s belongings, is to respect hers.”

“Oh, I guess I never thought of it like that,” Steve frowned. “I’m sorry.”

“Well, once you are done cleaning her up, before you take her down for story time, she and I can call her friend.”

Steve nodded.

“I’ll go start dinner now, so you can give her an earlier story night. It won’t due if she is tired in the morning when her friend comes to pick her up.”

“You’re right.”

Before the little princess knew it, she was already in a night diaper, down at the dinner table finishing her dinner, and her aunt was already asking her for the phone number for her friend.

Mariela went through her bag until she found her school rule book and showed the back cover to her aunt.

“Hello?” Aunt Susan spoke into the phone.

“Hello,” Jenna seemed to have answered, because then there was a long pause, and then Aunt Susan said “Hello” again.

“I know the kids made a very short notice plan on us,” Susan said to the other woman….”

Susan frowned as the woman responded.

“Oh, I see,” Susan said. “So I guess the kids were not really at fault this time, then?”

Mariela tried to pick up more cues.

“Yeah, I’ll have little Mariela ready to go at nine, but I’d like to talk to you a few minutes before you just take off with her. You’ll understand after our talk, but it’s really something that shouldn’t be discussed on the phone.”

Mariela knew what Susan wanted to talk to her about. She was going to likely to tell her to expect Mariela to pee her pants, and that she was going to wear a diaper. Oh well…. Even if Jenna finds out, there is not a lot she can do about it.

Uncle Steve took the little girl down to the story area after that, and getting her settled on his lap with a bottle of cola in her hands, of course they’d make her wet the bed tonight. That was a main part of the idea of who their niece was. Their niece would always wet the bed…. Anyway, with her bottle already in her hands, Uncle reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet, and kissing his little baby niece on the side of the head, he whispered to her.

“Don’t tell Auntie how much,” he told her. “Don’t lie. Just don’t tell her a number. She knows I was going to give you some spending money, baby.”

Mariela nodded.

Then, he gave her thirty dollars.

“Pick out something you want, and there should be enough to get you lunch besides, okay?”

Mariela smiled and nodded.

She pulled the bottle out of her mouth to ask, “What about the change?”

“You shouldn’t have any change,” he told her. “But if you do, I don’t want to know about it. Use it at school or whatever as you like.”

Mariela nodded.

“Are you still doing a story tomorrow night?” Mariela asked.

“Oh course, baby. And yes, I still expect you to be here for it. If you are too tired to play a cute character, I won’t force you to play a character, I want my little niece in my lap while we are doing this. You need to be seen as a regular part of the group.”

Mariela frowned. There was no way she’d feel comfortable leaving these people. They already had her going to middle school and making connections, they had her involved with his newly made Saturday story group, and from the previous Sunday, she was already accepted into the young women’s church group as well. How could she go back to the streets with no connections, no friends, no one to care about her, with everything that was going on now?

Once she had stuffed her money in a secret cubby in her story area, and she had climbed back on Uncle’s lap, Uncle gave her a light story, one that she really liked, and before she knew it, she was sleeping in his arms like almost every night this last week.

“Did you put the stuff in her bottle?” she thought she heard voice from far off. Her eyes only saw darkness though and her body was completely relaxed.

“Yes, honey, I made sure to give her enough to keep her asleep until she is awakened, and I also gave her that other one this time.”

“The directions say she’ll have to go within an hour, right?”

“That’s what they said,” the other voice echoed into the darkness and the voices seemed a little further away.

Then there was silence.

Again, the girl thought she heard something from very far away. Was it a school bell? Wait, was she sitting in a classroom, having fallen asleep, and having… gross! She felt under her bottom. Did she really? At school? No!

But then it all went black again, and the girl became immune to the sounds and visions of this world.

“Wake up,” Susan shook her little niece trying to wake her.

Mariela finally woke up, and her eyes still a little out of focus, tried to look up into her aunt’s face wondering why her aunt was panicking.

“Honey, we set your alarm. Didn’t you hear it?”

Mariela looked down at her alarm. There was a note on it like last Saturday.

Baby Mariela,

Watch Cartoons until eight, and then wake auntie for your morning bath. Your friend will be here at nine.

Love Auntie.

Mariela looked up at Susan. “What time?”

“It’s almost nine, honey, and you haven’t even had a bath yet. Come on, get out of your bed!”

The doorbell chimed.

“Oh no!” Auntie groaned. “Steve! Get the door?”

Auntie pulled the blankets away from Mariela, and then, Mariela felt something off. She was used to a wet diaper, but this was… this was not pee. It was not her period either. It felt a lot grosser.

Auntie helped her out of bed, and her diaper sagged down, pulling some of the sippery slime down with it from her bottom.

“You pooped your pants?” her aunt asked her without even taking off her pajama bottoms.

Mariela just looked down at the floor. She felt really gross.

“This is bad, honey. Your friend is here, and you are an absolute mess.”

The aunt walked her little niece towards the bedroom door, but Mariela heard people walking up the stairs. They would be between her and the bathroom before she was out of her room. She froze.

“What?” Auntie asked her. “Don’t tell me you are peeing again?”

Mariela put her thumb in her mouth shrugging. Did it matter if she was peeing her pants? She was already really gross.

Susan sighed and walked out of the room without her, and she heard her mom talking to the other people.

“Steve, why’d you let them up here?”

“Jenna, the little friend, wants to use the toilet.”

“Oh no,” Susan frowned and looked down.

“What’s wrong?” Jenna’s mom asked.

“The bathroom is right over there,” she heard Steve tell the friend.

Before Mariela registered what was going on, Susan led the other woman right into her room, where she stood next to the door in her messy pajamas, some of the poop had leaked out the leg area and she knew it was in her pajamas.

“You need to know,” Susan sighed. “I was going to tell you about her anyway today before you left, but I didn’t expect all of us to oversleep, either.”

“Did your little niece…?”

“Yeah, she pooped her pants. I think it was in her sleep, but I’m not sure, and I don’t want to ask in case it wasn’t. She’s already really upset.”

“Okay,” the other woman frowned.

Steve came in the bedroom and he looked down at Mariela, and he frowned.

“You had a bad one this time, huh, baby?”

Mariela looked at the floor, tears in her eyes, and her thumb in her mouth.

“Let’s go to the kitchen,” Susan told the woman. “I’ll explain everything to you. Mariela is used to Steve taking care of her, so he can get her cleaned up after your daughter is out of the bathroom.”

The woman frowned when she heard that Mariela was used to Steve taking care of her.

“Look, I know what you might be thinking,” Susan told her. “But Mariela….” And they continued their talk while they were walking away. Steve waited in the bedroom with his little twenty three year old poopy pants little niece.

There was a knock at her door.

“Come in,” Steve said, and so Jenna opened the door. The girl looked Mariela up and down, and then realized she had pooped her pants.

She walked in, and looking down, she whispered.

“An accident?”

Mariela nodded, tears running down her face.

“Well, you are going to clean up before we go, right?”

Mariela looked up at Steve.

“Of course she is,” he told Jenna. “Go down and wait with your mom, okay? Her Aunt Susan is explaining everything about little Mariela. And I know Mariela would really appreciate it if you didn’t tell people at school about finding her like this.”

“I won’t,” Jenna blushed and looked down. She mumbled.

“I peed the bed this morning, too, so if you don’t tell everyone about me, I won’t tell about you, okay?”

Mariela nodded.

Steve picked Mariela up in his arms, and he pointed the little friend out the door and down the stairs while he took the baby Mariela into the bathroom to clean up.

“Jenna didn’t really pee her pants last night,” Mariela told Steve.

“Why would she lie about that?”

“I don’t know, but she didn’t,” Mariela said to him trying to sound wise.

“Well, I know why she’d lie about it,” he touched her nose as he put her down to run some water in the tub. “She was trying to make you feel better. She was trying to make you feel like you had something on her if she told your school about this, so you would know she wouldn’t.”

Mariela looked down trying to pick apart whether that could be true.

Something is kind of off with this story, so I guess that's why not as many people are commenting on it. Maybe I should just... well, I have an idea or concept, but I don't think it is really working....

The Title also probably doesn't really fit with the story. So... sorry if you were following this, but I think I'm going to rewrite it, or possibly even make two different stories, one about going the maid direction and one going a little closer in line to this story line, but tweaking it a bit.

I really like this story. I'd really like to see more of Mariela having more accidents, also I'd like to see the plot with shopping with Jenna. Please, don't clancel or change this story.

I was talking with others, and thought maybe this story was missing some stuff, and that it could have been written a lot better, but after taking a while and talking a bit more about it with someone, I've decided to go ahead and continue the story. LOok for Chapter 12 soon....
