I remember reading this when I was younger and was wondering if it still exists in full somewhere. I know I've read the whole thing before. 

The fanfic is mentioned in this article: https://gizmodo.com/fan-fiction-friday-harry-potter-and-lucius-malfoy-real-5964738

If the OP decided to delete or something, that's fine. But I've been trying to find it with no results.
