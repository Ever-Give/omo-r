My first story commission: Thi story is about two college students Rex and Disha, who are extremely proud of their abilities to hold their pees. It consists of extreme desperation (24-48 hours). I hope you all enjoy this.

Meet Disha -

Sunset to Sunrise 2.0 -

Hi, my name is Rex, I am 19 and have recently joined college. Apart from fitness and my love for sex, I have addicted to holding my pee. Yup, you heard that right. Not wetting, but constantly staying painfully full – It feels so fucking good. And the longer I hold it, the better it feels. But the best part is trying to act normal when you're bursting at the seams. You have to be strategic about where you sit, how much you drink, and how you move. It's like a game of Jenga, and one wrong move could bring the whole tower tumbling down.

But this story is about me and the girl of my dreams. Read on to find out.

- - -

As I sat in the back row of the lecture hall, I couldn't help but notice the familiar sensation of a full bladder. But this was nothing new to me. I've always loved relishing the sensation of desperation that comes with a bursting bladder. In fact, I’d been holding my pee for 24 hours every day since I joined college and was trying to push beyond.

I looked around the room and noticed that I wasn't alone in my need to relieve myself. Four girls in the front row were squirming in their seats, clearly in desperate need of a piss. And there I was, sitting comfortably, proud of my ability to hold it in. I overheard the girls talking amongst themselves, whispering about their desperation and wondering if they should ask the professor for a break. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. These girls clearly had no idea what it meant to hold their bladder like a champ.

I decided to eavesdrop a little more, just to see how desperate they really were. It was both entertaining and a bit thrilling to hear them discussing their predicament.

One of the girls leaned over and whispered, "I can't hold it much longer, I need to go now."

Another girl responded, "Me too! But we can't just leave in the middle of class. What if the professor sees us?"

I smirked, feeling a sense of superiority. They had no idea what they were missing out on. But then, a new thought occurred to me. Maybe I could help them out. I cleared my throat and turned around to face them.

"Excuse me, ladies. I couldn't help but overhear your predicament. I happen to know a thing or two about taming the bladder. Maybe I can offer some advice."

They looked at me sceptically, but also with a glimmer of hope in their eyes. "Really?" one of them asked. "What can we do?"

I leaned in closer and whispered my secrets to them, sharing my tips for holding it in without anyone noticing like Kegels, scratching the calf and even pressing the bladder hard for a few seconds to increase the pressure and then allowing it to return to normal. They seemed both impressed and grateful.

The lecture soon ended, and I made my way out of the classroom just after the girls bolted out. I spotted the four girls huddled together in the corridor. They looked frustrated and were muttering under their breath. I couldn't resist walking up to them to see what was going on.

"What's up?" I asked, trying to suppress my amusement.

"The restrooms are closed due to a water line maintenance!" one of the girls exclaimed, throwing her hands up in frustration.

As much as I wanted to the girls to get more desperate, I thought it might be best to keep that to myself. Instead, I tried to act like I was just as frustrated as they were.

"Ugh, this is the worst!" I exclaimed, trying to play it cool.

Inside, I was actually thrilled at the prospect of having to hold it in for even longer. I had been drinking water and soda all day, the pressure in my bladder was not very easy to contain. But then again peeing could always wait. As we made our way off-campus, I couldn't help but notice that the girls were struggling more and more, fidgeting and crossing their legs, while I remained composed.

"So, how long have you guys been holding it?" I asked, trying to make conversation.

The girls exchanged a glance before one of them spoke up. "Since lunchtime," she admitted, looking embarrassed. “Just 5 hours and they are bursting!” I thought to myself.

I raised my eyebrows to act surprised. "Oh, wow. I've only been holding it for an hour or so," I lied, trying not to sound too smug. The girls groaned in unison, and I couldn't help but feel a small sense of victory. Holding my pee was like a sport to me, and I loved winning. Unfortunately, they spotted a public restroom and started walking towards it. As we reached the public restroom, I felt a little disappointed that the little adventure was about to end. But man, I was wrong!

- - -

After the girls finished using the public restroom, they were surprised to find me waiting outside, still holding it. They couldn't believe that I could continue to hold it. Little did they know I could single-handedly beat them at holding.

"Rex, you must be bursting by now!" exclaimed one of the girls.

I just smiled and shrugged it off. I didn't want to admit that I was actually dying to pee. I wanted to prove to them, and to myself, that I could hold it until I got home or may be even longer. I heard one of them speak to the others in a whisper, “Oh my god! He’s so much like Disha!” I was intrigued but didn’t say anything. My mind was racing though, to find out more about Disha. Why would they say that I was like Disha? Did she like to hold it as well?

As we walked back to the college, I felt my bladder jolt with every step, but it was still long before I would allow myself even a drop of relief. The girls, on the other hand, seemed to be relieved and happy to have emptied their bladders. They chatted and laughed while I just clenched and focused on keeping my waters contained.

Just as we reached the gate to our hostel zone, we saw a girl approaching us. My heart skipped a beat. The girls introduced her as Disha. She had jet black hair styled like a model, full kissable lips, and a body that looked like it was made for sin – be it her massive bouncing boobs barely contained in her crop top or her tiny miniskirt that barely covered her butt. Provocative – was an understatement. I couldn't help but stare at her, trying to hide my raging boner.

"Hey there, I'm Disha," she said, giving me a seductive knowing smile.

"Hi, I'm Rex," I replied, trying to sound as cool as possible.

"So, Rex, what brings you here?" Disha asked, eyeing me up and down. "I'm new here, just like you guys," I replied, trying hard to keep my eyes on her face. "Oh, that's cool. Which course are you in?" she asked. "Uh, mechanical engineering," I replied, hoping I didn't sound too nervous. Honestly speaking my heart was in my mouth.

We talked for a few more minutes, and I couldn't help but notice how Disha kept shifting her weight from one foot to the other subtly. I knew that look. She needed to pee, rather badly. Perhaps that was the reason the girls earlier commented that I was like Disha. I was proud of my ability to hold it, but I didn't know if Disha was as good at it as I was. I decided to test her when the rest of the girls made their way back to the dorms.

I kept talking to her and even took her out for a coffee, trying to distract her while she was clearly desperate to pee. As we downed a coffee or two, I could see Disha struggling to sit still. She kept crossing her legs and occasionally grabbing her thighs, trying to hide her urgent need. I was impressed by her determination, but also amused by her predicament. As we reached her hostel later in the evening, I could see that Disha was in a hurry to get to her room.

She bid me a quick goodbye and walked briskly to her building. It was a treat to watch her tiny skirt bounce on her bubble butt exposing her cheeks and a hint of the tight neon green thong underneath. I couldn't help but wonder if she would make it in time. I knew that feeling of desperation all too well – the last few moments of control as we go the proximity of a bathroom. I felt a strange attraction towards Disha. Later that night, as I lay in bed, I couldn't stop thinking about Disha. I wondered if she was able to hold it till she reached the restroom. Does she hold it regularly or today was one off event? How long she must have been holding? How much did she drink all day? I drifted off to sleep dreaming about her.

- - -

From the next day itself, I kept a close eye on Disha. I couldn't help but notice Disha's behaviour in class. At first, she would come in with her usual bubbly self, making flirtatious comments and giggling away. But as the day wore on, I could see her becoming more and more quiet, fidgeting in her seat, and looking increasingly uncomfortable. I noticed her chugging water from her bottle steadily throughout the day and also re-filling it during lunch time. That girl drank like gallons but never entered the ladies room with her friends.

On very few occasions had I encountered anyone else who took pride in holding their pee like I did. But with Disha, it felt as if I hit a jackpot. As the days went by, my curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to know more about Disha's habits and what drove her to hold her bladder to the absolute limits.

I watched her closely in class, noticing the way she squirmed in her seat and crossed and uncrossed her legs. I couldn't help but feel a little envious of her ability to hold it in for so long. As someone who prided themselves on their own holding skills, I was intrigued by Disha's seemingly effortless ability to do the same.

But I knew that bringing up the topic in front of her would be a mistake. For one, it was a little too personal of a subject to broach with someone I barely knew. And two, I didn't want to risk offending her or making her feel uncomfortable. So, I continued to observe her from afar, watching as she downed bottle after bottle of water and held her pee for hours on end. It was almost as if she was in competition with me, and I couldn't help but admire her tenacity.

As the days passed, I found myself becoming more and more intrigued by Disha. Her ability to hold her pee was impressive, but there was something else about her that drew me in. She was funny, smart, and incredibly mischievous. After a couple of weeks, I found her giving me sly glances in class or teasing me during breaks. It was almost as if she knew I was watching her and was enjoying the attention. And I couldn't help but feel a little smitten. But I knew that any romantic notions I had towards Disha were foolish. We were just two people with a shared interest in holding our bladders, nothing more, yet.

- - -

Around 3 months had passed since we met. During these months Disha had never used the toilets – at least not when I was around her. She acted as if she was immune to it. Right from the first lecture of the day to the last, she would be in the class steadily chugging water from her water bottle. I always kept up with her to ensure that I too can be desperate and relish the satisfaction of being under control. Subconsciously we both were trying to one-up each other. And man! It was intense but more was yet to come.

I, Disha, and the rest of the 4 girls were chosen to participate in a tech conference and were preparing for the same. We had to take a 16-hour bus ride to reach the destination. The night before we left, we gathered for the final rehearsal after dinner. But something was off about Disha today. I noticed that Disha was fidgeting more than usual. Her legs were crossed tightly, and she kept shifting in her seat. I could see the sweat on her forehead and her face was turning red. It was not her usual – I-AM-IN-CONTROL self.

"Hey, Disha, you okay?" I asked, trying to act as calm as possible while clenching my muscles. I had a constant dull ache in my bladder since lunch time.

She turned to me and responded with a forced smile "Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little nervous, I guess."

But I could tell there was something else going on. I glanced over at our four friends, who were all whispering and looking concerned.

"Guys, what's going on?" I asked.

One of the girls spoke up. "Disha really needs to go to the bathroom, but she's refusing to leave. We've been trying to convince her, but she's being stubborn."

Disha glared at her friend. "I'm not stubborn! I just don't want to miss anything important."

It was then I noticed that her regular water bottle was replaced with a new gallon sized one. My jaws dropped when I realized that it was empty and there were three empty juice cans kept next to it. Merely thinking about the intake made my bladder scream with pressure.

"Hey, it's okay Disha. Its already past the time when you normally take your before-bed gusher." One of the girls whispered into her ear. Much to Disha’s dismay it was heard by all of us.

Disha shook her head adamantly. "No, this is more important. I will not pee tonight! I'm fine."

But as the rehearsal went on, it became clear that Disha was not fine at all. She kept squirming in her seat and forgetting her lines. Finally, she burst out in frustration.

"I can't do this anymore! I-I need a break!"

We all looked at her in surprise. Disha was usually so composed and in control.

"Okay, let's take a break," I said, thinking that she had finally given in, but my jaws dropped when she asked her friend to get her a bottle of water.

“Don’t be stupid Disha! You don’t need to drink water but release yours!”

But Disha refused to budge. "No, I can hold it. I just need to – need to stay hydrated.”

I was having a raging hard on at the moment. Perhaps Disha’s pride to admit her needs was the only thing preventing me from rushing to the bathroom myself. We all exchanged worried glances, but no one wanted to push her too hard. So, I and another girl went to the canteen to fetch a bottle of water. On my way I asked the girl what was wrong with Disha.

“You will not believe! Disha just pees once a day and today we called her for the rehearsal just when she was about to finally relieve herself.”

“Only once-a-day! That must be so difficult!” I tried to act casual.

“It is! When we all came to the college, she used to pee twice, but I don’t know why she started restricting herself to only once a day!”

“Is she always so irate when she gets back to the dorm after the lectures, ever since her once-a-day rule started?”

“God! You should see her once she’s in the room! She squirms like crazy, and her hand is glued to her crotch!” She giggled. My dick was as hard as steel at that moment.

“I don’t know but perhaps she is trying to beat you!”

“What do you mean!?” I was taken aback.

“Oh C’mon! All the girls in the class know you never go to the bathroom all day... I mean just look at the rest of guys who rush out every two hours.”

I felt my hard on grow larger as she continued. “It’s so manly to be able to wait. Looking at you right now all four of us can pounce on you to suck you.” She paused upon realizing that she blurted too much. “Be honest though – Don’t you need to pee?”

“Ahhh!” I didn’t expect the question. “It’s definitely there but nothing I can’t manage!” I lied through my teeth. My teeth were afloat with piss. But relief was not an option especially after knowing what the girl said. My mind was racing with the thoughts of Disha - a hot busty girl, trying to pee only once a day, trying to beat me. The rest of the girls talking about sucking me. It felt like Christmas!

Soon after we got her a bottle of water from the canteen. On my way back I chugged a bottle myself to keep up with my dangerous game. The girl looked at me with suspicion. I just brushed it off saying that I hadn’t had any water since lunch. Disha’s eyes grew wide in horror as I gave her the bottle with a knowing glance. She slowly started drinking it, shifting in her seat every few seconds and her face contorted with effort.

Finally, it was my and Disha’s turn to present the slides. We could see that Disha was holding her breath between her sentences. Her hand was tightly clutching the hem of her short skirt as if trying to pull it down. The tight waist band was cutting right on the apex of her bladder. She stood absolutely still, with her legs crossed tightly. We could literally see the muscles on her legs were flexed with strain. Each time she made a mistake the girls made us start from the beginning. Little did they know my bladder was ready to pop too. I was gritting my teeth and clenching my muscles non-stop. There was no way on earth I was letting Disha know that I had to pee like a racehorse.

After a gruelling hour the rehearsal finally ended. I was no longer safe. My bladder was trying to push out the load violently. The first few drops of pee had reached the tip of my dick. My body was covered in sweat and I had goosebumps on my body. It had been 27 hours with more than a gallon of intake. It was too much for my bladder. I wanted to sprint out of the room but held on somehow. Disha on the other hand was practically pee dancing now. Her hands revolved around her crotch, sometimes holding her belly bulge, sometimes tugging on to the hem of her skirt.

“Hurry up guys!” Disha pleaded her friends with strained voice. Her legs were glued together.

“Wait it out Disha! We are almost done!” Her friend snapped at her. It was so sudden and abrupt that Disha was startled. Her bladder gave in, and a jet of pee escaped. Her neon green thong had turned dark. She clenched herself and took a seat crossing her legs as tight as she could.

“Disha! I think you should go.” I offered to help her. She was in no position to fight it. Her bladder simply would not have any of her non-sense any longer.

“NO! I – I can wait” Disha glared at me. Her face was red with strain and true to her words she didn’t make a move to rush out to the toilets. As we walked back to our dorms with Disha and the others, I could see that Disha was on the verge of tears. She was walking with her legs tightly crossed, and every few steps she would pause and clench her muscles. I wanted to offer her some words of encouragement, but I didn't know what to say. So, I just walked alongside her, trying to keep a neutral expression and focus on my own needs to release the lake inside me.

When we reached the dorm, Disha was doing a full-blown pee dance. Her eyes were shut close and hands grabbing the hem of her skirt. Her face had turned blue due to holding her breath. The girls on the other hand were keeping up with small talk running through our itinerary for the next day.

“Girls! How much longer?” Disha pleaded.

“Take the keys and rush inside. We will be there in 5” One of them tried to hand over the keys.

“Oh! It – its fine. I will wait with you guys!” Disha answered rubbing the tears of her cheeks but still unwilling to accept defeat. I was no better than her. Perhaps the girls knew that and were trying to delay us. Whatever. After 5 minutes we left. As soon as I turned my back, I heard Disha snatch the keys and bolt inside, muttering cuss words. A moment later a loud moan was heard across the corridor. I went back near to their room on the pretext of forgetting something and heard the sound of a loud gush coming from the bathroom.

The girls could not hold their laughter seeing me. One of them picked up her wet thong and showed it to me. It was drenched with piss. I was salivating at it. “Do you wanna join her?” One of the girls teased me. “I – No! I will go later” I sheepishly bade them a good night and waddled back to my dorm, satisfied that I outheld her. I could not wait for the trip to push myself harder and thus I went to bed cancelling my before bed pee. My bladder screamed for a release, but I silenced it.

- - -

I woke up with a painfully full bladder. I had to knead my dick for a good few minutes to bring the surge of pressure under control. 25 hours’ worth of pee and over a gallon of water was tightly corked up in my swollen bladder. Skipping my only pee of the day was a dangerous game, but the kick of doing this while out with Disha was irresistible.

Before I stepped out of the dorm, I jokingly texted the girls, "Ladies, make sure to empty yourselves before you board the bus!" I received a chorus of giggles and affirmative responses from everyone except Disha. She was on her phone, furrowing her eyebrows. We all headed to get some breakfast before boarding. I was pleasantly full and had to calculate how much I and her were drinking. Before we knew, we both had downed a jug of orange juice, easily about 1500ml. We gave each other a knowing look.

A while later we got on the bus. I took a seat next to Disha and couldn’t help but notice a small bulge on her bladder. One of the girls came and asked her if she wanted to pee and it was the last chance. As a response Disha simply tightened her belt one more notch.

“No thank you! Rules are rules!” Disha coldly said. The girl got her answer and they all left for the toilets.

“Why does everyone make such a fuss about peeing?” Disha was annoyed.

“Perhaps because you were miserable last night Disha!” I teased Disha.

“Do you even know how much I was holding! I had not peed since the night before yesterday and I pee only once every day. Instead of appreciating me, you guys keep on squandering my efforts day and had drank one full gallon of water and god knows how much of juices and drinks.”

“All right! Chill, I am sorry.” I was expecting to have a good time with her on the trip but I pulled the wrong string.

“I am a big girl Rex, and I can contain my waters. And you know what, I cancelled my cautionary pee which I had thought of earlier specially for today’s ride, just to prove to you all that my bladder can practically hold a lake. And oh yes! I drank over a litre of water before I slept.” She was enraged. I simply nodded to her anticipating the pain I was going to put myself through. I massaged my bladder which contained over 24 hours’ worth of pee already. Deep down I knew it was going to be the most difficult hold of my life. It was better to wet than accept my needs to Disha.

The journey stared without much hassle. Though the Air conditioning was wreaking havoc on Disha. She put her hoodie on and kept her arms crossed, clearly shivering. Perhaps the yellow microskirt was not the smartest choice for such a long ride. On the other hand, I was sweating profusely, my shirt stuck to my skin, thanks to the effort of took to I act normally. When I lowered the temperature she would turn off the overhead blower. The other girls enjoyed our silly quarrel. This back and forth continued for quite some time till I conceded and let her win. This would be the only thing I let her win at.

A few hours passed and the bus made a stop for lunch. The girls immediately made a beeline for the toilets, but Disha stayed put. I took the opportunity to grab some lunch for myself and her. Needless to say we had already chugged our bottles somehow. Thus a monstrous soda was due with lunch and additional water bottles. Before I entered the bus I secretly watched Disha from the gate of the bus which was tinted. I could faintly see that her face was contorted, hands shoved in her crotch and legs fanning frantically. She did need to pee after all. I felt so proud of myself.

As soon as I entered the bus, her hands flew away from her crotch. “You took a pee, didn’t you?” she asked, almost accusingly. "Nope" I answered as calmly as I could. Truth be told I was in agony, but I would not give in so easily. I wanted this to be excruciating. The journey resumed and half of the soda was making its way to our overworked bladders. Disha crossed her legs like a pretzel pretending to be cold. I being the gentleman I was, offered her my jacket which she gladly took.

Apart from that she gave no other signs about her growing need. I glanced at her side from time to time and found that the monstrous soda was gone. I made sure to finish mine, despite my Bladder begging not to. With every gulp it was becoming more and more difficult to keep up with the act.

An hour or two later, Disha was visibly uncomfortable, shifting in her seat every few minutes. The pretension of being colder was gone and I could see sweat beads forming on her forehead, and her breathing was getting heavier. One of the girls took pity on her and asked if she should ask the driver to pull over. But Disha remained resolute in her decision to hold it in.

As the hours passed, the pressure inside my bladder rose to a whole new level. Every bump on the road felt like torture. My dick throbbed with pain as pee kept rushing to the tip in waves. I was savouring the discomfort. But I couldn't show any signs of weakness, not when Disha sat next to me.

At one point, the bus hit a particularly rough patch of road, and Disha let out a small whimper. I could tell that her resolve was starting to falter. I quickly calculated our intakes since the morning. A giant soda worth 800ml, 3 bottles of water which meant 1500ml, our morning juice was another 1500. We had a gallon of liquid coursing through our bodies. I couldn’t even tally all the liquid from the previous day already gurgling inside. We continued our silent suffering.

As the sun began to set, the air conditioning on the bus seemed to get colder and colder. I was shivering, my teeth chattering uncontrollably. Disha, on the other hand, had her hoodie and my jacket on. She still seemed to be sweating. All our water bottles were empty now. My body was shuddering with the desperation. I glanced at the clock, it had been 38 hours since I felt any relief. Perhaps 20 for her.

It was a strange dichotomy, but neither of us was willing to even jokingly admit our need. We gave each other a knowing look. Keeping the hands away from the crotch was so difficult but I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of falling weak. We were both determined to outlast the other.

Soon the bus pulled for dinner. The moment the bus stopped, both Disha and I turned our heads towards the restrooms longingly, but we both knew the rules. No one was supposed to pee. The other girls, however, were not so compliant.

“Guys, come on, just go pee! It’s been nearly a day guys! I’m sure you’re both dying to pee” one of them pleaded.

Disha shot her a glare. “I’m fine, thank you. I want to hold it.”

I nodded in agreement, trying my best to look as composed as possible. “Yeah, we’re both good. Thanks for your concern, though.”

The girls seemed to give up and headed to the restrooms. As soon as they were gone, Disha and I both let out a sigh of relief. We both sat there, silent, each lost in our own thoughts, trying to ignore the growing pressure inside us. The rest of the girls returned and we resumed our journey. The night sky was beautiful and the stars were shining brightly. But we could hardly appreciate the view as our minds were only focused on one thing - the unbearable pressure in our bladders. There was still 5 more hours to go to the journey and we were nearing our limits. But more trouble was to come. In the middle of nowhere the bus got punctured.

As soon as the bus came to a halt, everyone began to panic. The driver got out to examine the tire and we were all asked to wait inside. I tried to distract myself by checking my phone but my mind was too focused on my bladder. Disha was curled up in her seat, legs crossed tightly like a pretzel, almost weeping. She kept shifting in her seat and biting her lip.

“You okay?” I whispered, trying to hide my own discomfort.

She nodded, trying to put on a brave face. “Yeah, I’m fine,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. The minutes ticked by agonizingly slowly, each one feeling like an eternity. Finally, after what seemed like hours, the driver returned and announced that we would have to wait for a replacement bus. My heart sank. I knew I couldn’t hold on much longer.

"I just want to reach the hotel," Disha whispered, her voice shaking with desperation. I nodded in agreement. The fun part of holding was replaced with necessity. Even though I wouldn’t looking relieve myself I find myself around frantically for any sign of relief. But there was nothing. We were stranded in the middle of nowhere, with no restrooms in sight.

Looking at the other passengers rushing behind the bushes was pure torture. I could hear the sound of their relief echoing in the silence. The girls came back one by one, looking refreshed and relieved, but also giving us pitiful looks.

"Are you sure you don't want to go?" one of them asked, trying to be helpful.

"We're good," I replied through gritted teeth, trying my best to hide the desperation in my voice. But the truth was that I was far from good. The pressure was becoming unbearable, and my mind was slowly losing control. I tried to distract myself by talking to Disha about anything and everything, but it was getting harder and harder to focus.

"How much longer?" Disha asked, her voice trembling with desperation as she got up from the seat. For a moment I couldn’t believe that she gave in. She inched towards the door. I don’t know what was she thinking.

"Not sure, but it could be a while. But where are you going though" I replied, trying to keep my cool.

“I just need some time alone” Disha was breathed through her mouth making a hissing sound. Her legs were glued together and fists shaking. Sweat dripped from her forehead to her deep cleavage.

But before she could get some alone time, the driver came back and informed us that it would be at least another two hours before the replacement bus arrived and asked all of us to get down. I could see Disha almost pull her hair in frustration. I could relate to her as a quick squeeze down there could make things so much better. But pride and stubbornness kept me from doing so. up. So far I had not shown any signs of desperation.

As time passed, the situation became increasingly dire. I could feel my bladder pulsing with pain, and Disha was no better off. Her face was contorted in pain, and she was sweating profusely despite the cold air conditioning.

"Are we there yet?" she asked, her voice strained and desperate.

"Not yet" I replied, trying to keep the panic out of my voice.

The last hour was the hardest. My mind was starting to lose control, and I found myself squirming in my seat, trying to find some relief. Every passing moment felt like an eternity, and I was starting to wonder if we would ever reach the hotel.

The last hour was the hardest. My mind was starting to lose control, and I found myself squirming in my seat, trying to find some relief. The insides of my bladder were burning. I had never felt pain like this ever in my life. I was starting to wonder if we would ever reach the hotel. But then, finally, we did. Two hours later than planned, but we made it. As we rose from the seat, I saw a small wet patch on Disha’s seat. She had leaked. I knew it! Her control was slipping. Wearing such a short skirt was not a good idea after all, I chuckled to myself.

As we stepped off the bus and got down, gravity hit us hard. I felt as if somebody had attached a bowling bowl to my stomach. An intense wave hit me and I had to pause there bringing my legs close. The notch of my belt was still at the tightest setting. I could feel the heat coming out of my ears and my heart beat like a race car engine. My body was begging for a release. 42 hours had passed since my last partial pee, and I had chugged like a big bucket of water.

“Look at you Rex. You’re gonna burst!” One of the girls came running to me, showing me the way to the restroom in the lobby. My desperation rose 10 times as soon as my eyes fell on the door. Imagine drinking vodka out of the bottle and how it burns down your chest. It was exactly similar except it was my pee rushing to the tip of my dick.

I held my breath and clenched my muscles. “How’s Disha doing?” I asked with my eyes shut close. “Not better”, she answered.

“Babe you haven’t peed since last night. You have honoured your rule. Just go!” The other three girls tried to persuade Disha. She was teary eyed but looked at me expectantly that I would be the first one to break.

“How the fuck is he still holding it!” I overheard Disha talking to the girls.

“Babe he is strong.“ the girls looked at me slyly.

“I am stronger. And strong girls don’t pee!” Disha was angry and irritated.

I was turned on and taken aback at the same time. How could a girl who can barely stand with a pregnant like bladder bulge, still want to beat me. I could not give her the satisfaction of defeating me. I took a deep breath and stood straight. With the last reserves of my strength, I straightened my body and said something which turned Disha pale.

"I think I will retire to bed. Peeing can wait till tomorrow morning or later.” Their jaws dropped to the ground. I smiled to them and walked as normally as I could towards the elevator. I was stacked with two of the girls and Disha with the rest.

Disha perhaps never thought I could beat her. Me opting to fight for another night was getting on her nerves. Despite it, she was too prideful to admit defeat. "He - He is right. Peeing can wait" Disha strained herself and waddled to her room with the rest of two girls.

The night was difficult, but I was determined to hold it till the morning. Our rooms were next to each other.

“WOAH! didn’t know your bladder could expand so much!” I could clearly hear conversation in the other room. Thanks to the weird low quality walls.

“No. I contain more than this every day. Its – Its just that it was too cold in the bus which made me weak momentarily” Disha lied.

“It’s huge! How the fuck did we not spot it earlier?” Another girl commented.

“Yeah! Waist – clincher. I – I compressed my bladder under it all day” Disha was struggling to form sentences. “Aahh! Don’t touch it” Disha suddenly snapped. The pressure was making her cranky. Obviously so.

I was enjoying their conversation and so were the girls with me. I signalled them to keep their voices low. They giggled and agreed to it on one condition.

“You gotta let us feel your bladder. We have never seen a guy as strong and manly like you” I was instantly hard. I smiled nervously as I finally unbuttoned my jeans and instantly fekt better The curve of my bladder went as high as my navel button. My skin was white, and I could count my veins. The girls had no clue what a dangerous situation I was in, but it was too late to back off. Despite all my pain I let them torture my bladder. They started slowly pressing it but it escalated quickly. I was pinned down by them. To my horror, they took turns to sit on it and bounce vigorously.

“This is going to be a long night tiger” As much as I enjoyed being blown by them, my dick threatened to gush the pee in their faces. I gripped the bed so tight that I tore into the bedsheet and the mattress. Not a drop of pee could escape or I would be doomed.

Disha on the other hand was silent, but I could faintly hear her tossing and turning around.

An hour later the girls were asleep on my chest and their knees were right on my bladder. My eyes were paining out of tiredness and my bladder felt as it was being stung by bees from inside.

Around 4 in the morning, I could hear the girls in the other room suddenly wake up.

“What’s wrong Disha?” One of the girls groggily asked.

“No - Nothing I just needed to.”

“Go to the toilet?” The other girl questioned.

“Noooo…Why would I go there the toilet in the middle of the night? I – I am just thirsty.” My eyes grew wide in amusement and horror at the same time. The next moment I heard water being poured in the glass and Disha quickly chug it down, slamming the glass on the table. I had to keep up with her. I reached out to the bottle kept next to our bed, sliding the naked hotties over my stomach. I chugged the full bottle groaning with a sharp pain from my Bladder.

I have no clue how I fell asleep but the next I woke up, it was 7 in the morning. 49 fucking hours without a drop of relief. My body was drenched in sweat and the entire bedsheet too. There was no semblance of composure left in me. My body demanded relief. I suddenly remembered about Disha waking up in the middle of the night to drink water. My mind was clouded with questions. Did she pee already? Did she wet herself? If not, then Disha would be holding around 31 hours’ worth of pee and countless litres.

Soon enough my questions were answered. I heard Disha pacing around the room and the other two girls were taking turns to get ready. She still had not accepted defeat. Perhaps I underestimated her.

I woke the girls in my bed and was welcomed with a nice juicy blowjob. My dick was hard as iron partly because I wanted to ejaculate a massive load and other because of the boiling pee gushing to find an escape. The other girl teased me about how badly she needed to pee and knowingly kept the door open as she took a strong morning pee. I winced in bed at the sound of it. But the torture was far from over. The piss was followed by her taking a shower which made me drive nuts. I was biting my lip so hard that I bled. In the meantime, the girl continued with the slurpy blowjob. As her tongue ravaged my dick I was starting to feel the ever-familiar pressure getting stronger.

“How are you feeling now Rex?” She seductively asked.

“Please s-stop!” I panted. My breath was erratic. Toes curled. Fingers dug into the mattress and dick about to explode. “I can’t hold it much longer”

“Oh Rex, you must!” She purred and deepthroated me. I was pulling my hair. I was in full blown panic now.

In the meantime, I heard something that was never expected. “OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR! FUCKING LET ME PEE NOW! I AM GOING TO EXPLODE” Disha banged the bathroom door like no tomorrow. There was a muffled answer from inside which I figured was the other girl asking her to wait. “I CAN’T FUCKING WAIT. I haven’t pissed for the last 32 hours!” Disha cried as the other girl in her room burst out in laughter. “No! NO! NOOOO! Don’t you dare!” It was Disha screaming as the other girl started tickling her. I could hear Disha panting and begging to let go but the other girl was relentless. It was pure commotion. For a minute I felt that all the 4 girls had planned to gain sadistic pleasure out of our pain!

This continued for another 15-20 minutes and then as if I connected with Disha through telepathy.

“ENOUGH! Let me go – NOW” I and Disha both shouted at the same time.

I literally pushed the girl blowing me, aside and grabbed my dick for dear life. There was no more waiting – it was my body’s PEE-NOW moment. Perhaps same was the case with Disha. I waited with bated breath for the bathroom door to open. As soon as it opened I bolted inside, drops of pee starting to leak out of my aching erect dick. I stood in front of the porcelain bowl begging for my dick to go flaccid. Seeing the bowl in front of me, my bladder went into a hyper-agitated mode – forcing bursts of piss. But my arousal prevented a release with full force. Not knowing what to do I held my breath hoping to calm my dick down.

In the meantime, I heard the bathroom door of the other side open and close. The bathrooms were adjacent to each other just like the rooms.. I heard the sound of cloth being torn away followed by a prolonged moan. A loud noise of piss hitting the water, filled the bathrooms. I closed my ears in pain as my dick still refused to go soft. Disha on the other hand was pissing like a fire hose. Around a minute later, somehow her stream stopped mid-stream “Hold it – hold it – hold it” I heard Disha muttering under her breath. I couldn’t believe she was still trying to control it but her bladder won in the end and violently pushed out the remainder of the piss with even more force. “OHHHH GODDDDDDDDDDDD!” Disha moaned in exasperation.

It was only then my dick finally turned semi-hard allowing the lake of piss to gush out of my pee. My body shivered as whole of the piss tried to make its way out. I could see my dick literally puff due to the pressure of the piss rushing out. I had never needed to pee so – so fucking bad in my life. I could feel steam emanating from the WC as it filled it to the brim.

Neither me nor Disha realized that the girls were calling us from outside to check on us. There was a deafening noise of liquid hitting liquid echoing throughout. Only when they started banging the doors from outside, it dawned to us how long we had been pissing for.

“Just let me piss in peace!” Disha screamed with a strained voice as her bladder continued to gush out a thick stream of piss.

“I am trying to hold it back, but it just won’t stop” I tried to sound calm.

After a good couple of minutes, Disha’s stream came to an abrupt stop. Her bladder expelled the entire load with such force that there was no slow down at all. I on the other hand went on for another minute or so, filling the WC to the brim. I had to clench my muscles before the piss spilled on the floor creating a mess. I couldn’t believe my eyes. All that piss was contained within my bladder. It was like a record in itself. Feeling proud I quickly took out my phone and clicked photos to keep proof of it. My bladder was still aching with the remaining piss desperately wanting out. But there was literally no way to further release it.

I came out of the bathroom with the girls rushing inside only to scream in disbelief. I collapsed onto the bed drenched in sweat. The other two girls barged into our room and went straight to the bathroom to see what happened.

“Did he piss all this?” The girls from the other room asked in amazement.

“Yes! Rex held this lake inside, all day since yesterday!” One of my girls said.

“Dang! I thought only Disha was corked up. You must check out her monstrous release”.

I could not bear it anymore. I quietly walked up to Disha’s room. She laid there on the bed, naked. Her body glistened with sweat and boobs heaved up and down due to her panting. She gave me a steely glance and I returned it with same ferocity. As I slowly walked into the bath, she smirked at me. The scene was absolute chaos inside. I saw a torn thong lay on the floor in a puddle of piss, and the WC was just half an inch short to the brim.

I smiled to myself. It was like a dream come true. The sexiest girl in the college was also a pro at holding it. I felt my dick stiffen inside my tight underwear as if my dick approved of her.

“Looks like I won after all.” She triumphantly said with a weak voice. A moment later, she came and stood behind me.

“Not quite!” I showed her the photos of my bathroom with the WC spilling over.

“Perhaps you need to work harder Disha. But you’re strong and worthy.” I palpated my bladder to show her a prominent bulge still there. Disha’s eyes widened in disbelief.

All she could muster to say was, “Challenge Accepted”.

My second story commission: This story is about a 19 year old, hot gamer girl - Jean, who needs a huge sum of money to go under the knife. She chooses a rather interesting way to get that money. Meet Jean.

&&

*015*2023-04-15 11:19

Bursting Jean:

"The one and only Jean, the 19-year-old gaming goddess that leaves her subscribers drooling and begging for more! With her sharp gaming skills and daring fashion choices, Jean has set the bar high for all gamer girls out there. Whether she’s slaying dragons in her skimpy bikini or taking on the enemy team in her thigh-high boots, Jean is always pushing the boundaries of not only gaming but also her overflowing bladder. Yes, Jean always games with a bladder-about-to-explode. No other girls out there can beat her.

So hold onto your controllers, folks, because Jean is about to take you on a wild ride that you won’t soon forget!"

That’s what, her intro read on the streaming website. But before all this Jean had an adventure, more like an Origin story, which lead her to become the most sought-after gamer. Read on to find out.

Scene 1: The Plan

Jean sat at her desk, scrolling through pictures of models with huge fake boobs. She sighed and looked at her moderate sized boobs and bit her lips with greed. Jean was by no means an average girl. Most of the girls of her age would die to get a chiseled body like her. And her height was perfect at 5’3”- the fun size as she called it. But she wanted more. She wanted massive boobs and desperately wanted to get a boob job done. The image of her having boobs bigger than her head, was ingrained in her mind.

Suddenly, an idea struck her. She turned to her best friend Tess, who was sitting on the couch in her room with her laptop.

"Tess, I've got it! I'm going to do a subathon to raise money for my boob job!" Jean exclaimed. Her eyes glowing with thrill.

Tess raised an eyebrow. "A subathon? You mean those livestreams where you do challenges and people donate money? That sounds like a lot of work."

Jean shook her head. "No, it'll be easy. I'll just play games and perform challenges while wearing my most daring outfits. People will be throwing money at me in no time." Tess chuckled. "And what kind of outfits are we talking about here?"

Jean grinned mischievously. "Oh, you know, a little too revealing, a little too tight, a little more cleavage. I want to make sure I grab people's attention."

"The more the skin - the more the green.” Tess laughed. “But are you sure you want to do this? These kind of streams trend to go on for hours."

Jean's eyes sparkled with excitement. "I'm totally up for it. In fact, I'm thinking of making it even more thrilling for myself."

"How so?" Tess asked.

"I'm going to hold my pee the entire time," Jean said with a smirk.

Tess's jaw dropped. "Are you crazy? You're going to be sitting there for 24 hours, drinking gallons and corking up a full bladder?"

Jean shrugged. "It'll be a fun challenge. And imagine the sensation when the pressure builds, pressing against my G-spot and then finally letting it all out." Goosebumps appeared on her body in excitement.

Tess shook her head in disbelief. "You're a crazy girl, Jean. But I do agree, holding it in is so much HOT! Plus, if it gets you the money you need for your surgery, go for it."

Scene 2: The Subathon Begins Tess sat on the couch, munching on popcorn as she ogled at Jean, her jaw dropping at her friend's skimpy outfits. "Oh my God, Jean! How are you not freezing in that? You’re practically naked" Tess asked, pointing at Jean's skimpy outfit. Jean wore an eye wateringly tight crop top with a plunging neckline. It was clearly smallest size she could get. It gave her a substantial cleavage and her boobs was could pop out any second. She coupled it with a neon orange thong and tight low waist jeans.

Jean grinned mischievously. "Oh, I have my ways," she said, winking at the camera. "I'll be sure to show you all some of my moves later."

“Did you go the bathroom though?”Tess was curious.

“Nope. I’m holding it since evening 6” Jean bit her lips in arousal. “It is more tantalising then I thought”.

“It sure is,” Tess pointed to her own bladder bulge. Jean’s eye widened with excitement.

The stream started exactly at midnight. As the hours went on, Jean's viewers grew more and more enthusiastic, throwing money at her to complete various challenges. Jean giggled as she read out some of the requests.

"Jean, can you do a cartwheel in those heels?" | "Can you twerk to this song?" | "Jean, can you do a handstand while holding a shot glass in your mouth?"

Jean eagerly obliged, relishing in the attention and the money pouring in. She felt a thrill every time a new subscriber signed up or donated, knowing that she was one step closer to her dream surgery. But as the night wore on, Jean started to feel a different kind of thrill. She had been holding her pee for hours now, and the pressure was starting to build. The empty water bottles kept reminding how much she had consumed. But she refused to break the seal, relishing in the challenge of holding it for a full 24 hours. She could already feel the sensation of relief that would come with finally letting go. Meanwhile, her subscribers continued to flood her chat with messages and requests, completely unaware of Jean's naughty little secret. But Jean couldn't help but grin wickedly to herself, knowing that she was in for a wild ride. The subathon had only just begun, and she was ready for anything they could throw at her.

Scene 3: The Urge Morning dawned. Jean didn’t allow herself even a drop of relief for 12 long hours. Around 2 litres of water were coursing in her system. There was a prominent bulge in her bladder.

"Ohhh," Jean thought to herself, trying to push away the feeling of urgency. "The pressure feels so good but it's getting to much to bear. I must fight it.. It’s just 18 more hours"

Jean’s attire was made of thick latex and it began to take its toll on her bladder. Every slight movement or shift caused a wave of pressure to shoot through her body.

To make matters worse, the air conditioning in her apartment was on full blast. Jean had turned it up to keep her subscribers entertained with her perky nipples, but the cold air was wreaking havoc on her bladder. She was second guessing her decision to skip her before-start-pee and all the extra water she drank instead. But the thought of the added challenge had been too thrilling to resist.

Jean's concentration was wavering and she missed a few requests from get fans. Her desperation was growing by the minute, and her subscribers could sense it. They began to leave comments, egging her on to keep holding, but also begging her to give in and pee. Jean was determined not to let them down, even if it meant enduring the discomfort for hours on end.

But as the hours turned into the afternoon, Jean's determination was put to the ultimate test. 20 hours had passed since her last pee and 14 hours into the subathon, her body was demanding relief, but she was too stubborn to accept defeat especially when her subscribers were watching her every move.

She shifted again in her chair, squeezing her legs together tightly. "Oh, God," she whispered to herself. "I can't take it anymore." But even as she spoke the words, Jean knew she couldn't give up. She had made a promise to herself and her subscribers, and she was determined to see it through to the end.

Scene 4: The Challenges Jean clenched her fists under the desk, trying to focus on the challenges, but it was getting harder and harder to ignore the relentless pressure. Her mind was starting to play tricks on her, making her think about waterfalls and running water.

"I can do this," she whispered to herself, trying to convince herself that she could make it to the end of the subathon. But then another challenge came in, and Jean knew it was going to be her downfall.

One of her subscribers had asked her to do a sexy dance in her tight, revealing outfit. Jean stood up and started moving her hips, trying to distract herself from the urge to pee. But as the dance went on, her legs started to shake uncontrollably, and she knew she was about to lose control.

She quickly sat down, crossing her legs tightly and trying to keep a straight face.

"I need to pee so bad," she whispered to Tess, who was giggling in the background.

"You can do it, girl," Tess encouraged her, but Jean wasn't so sure. Before Jean could say anything, her screen pinged with a new message from a subscriber. "I bet you can't defeat the superboss in megablaster game. If you die, you drink a glass of water and repeat it till you defeat him" it read.

Jean's eyes widened with horror and the comment section was on fire. She nervously fidgeted in her seat and her heart was racing – “How the duck do I defeat the superboss when I can’t really even sit straight!” She was teary eyed remembering that it took her 7 tries to defeat him at the easiest setting, let alone when her bladder was boiling with 23 hours of piss. She took a deep breath, crossed her legs as tightly as she could, and began.

Holding the controller was pure torture. The vibrations of the controller somehow travelled to her bladder making her squirm, non-stop. 3 hours passed but she didn’t succeed and her poor bladder had to bear all the brunt of it. 5 tall glasses of water, we’re downed by Jean, each hitting her bladder like a freight train. The bulge in her bladder had pushed the waist band of her tight jeans down to her crotch. But after a long struggle, Jean was able to defeat the superboss. She felt proud of herself and the satisfaction of doing so on a bladder that could explode any moment brought her a different kick.

Scene 5: The Outburst 26 hours since her last piss - 4 litres of water - 20 hours into the subathon - Jean was hanging by a thread. Her body was drenched in sweat and face red as tomato. She was shaking with the efforts to contain the tremendous pressure. “I can't take much more of this," Jean thought, her mind racing as she tried to come up with ways to distract herself. All her will power was focussed on keeping her hands away from her crotch. For Jean that was the sign of defeat. Her eyes darted to the clock, willing time to move faster, but it felt like an eternity had passed since the subathon began.

"I want to finish the subathon for all my fans but … I AM BURSTING" Jean moaned, her voice barely above a whisper. She was squirming in her seat, her hands shaking as she tried to maintain her composure. The subscribers were loving it. They were sending in more requests, taking advantage of Jean's desperation. Jean was determined not to give up but her body refused to obey. It wanted relief - NOW!. Her eyes fell on the door of the bathroom which was so close and yet so far. She had made it this far, and she wasn't going to let her bladder win. She closed her eyes tight and took a deep breath, focusing all her energy on the next challenge but little did she what was coming next.

Tess herself had joined Jean’s server and challenged her to put on vibrating panties, which the subscribers would control – turn by turn using an onscreen QR code. Jean glared at Tess, which made her go nuts with laughter. But there was nothing Jean could do. Any sudden movement would mean a disaster and end of the wonderful sensation of arousal which kept her going on.

Ted’s pulled Jean aside from the camera and pulled her tight jeans and thong, down with a single tug. She pulled out a fresh set of vibrating undie, which was perhaps the smallest size and wiggled it on Jean. Her bladder was bulging obscenely. A sudden scratch of a nail would have been enough to pop it. The waistband of the undie was viciously cutting into her bladder. Tess noticed Jean's inability to move and dragged her to the camera. Jean's face was contorted with the efforts of keeping the flood inside. As soon as the fans saw her in that tight undie, they were in a frenzy. The money indicator at the top right of the screen kept increasing like the numbers of a stop watch.

Then Tess began the game began and released the QR Code on screen. Within a blink of an eye, wild eccentric vibration ravaged Jean’s clit. Her eyes rolled back and hands flew to her crotch. The intensity of vibration varied from extreme to extreme at different settings, rotations and speeds. She was in a state of fit. It felt as if the best cocks in the world were pounding her all at the same time. Her mind was foggy with arousal and wild instincts. Her bladder on the other hand hated the rapid erratic movements. It raided Jean with spasms and waves of desperation, each stronger than the previous. Had it but been for the vibrating undies, Jean would have flooded the room. But her relief was a distant dream.

For the next 6 hours Jean’s pussy was oozing rivers of cum. Thick white liquid ran down her toned milky legs, filling her heels. Her hands were shoved tight on her crotch and her fingers were all sticky. Her undie cling to her soft shaven pussy as the flood of cum kept coming. Never in her life had Jean experienced such strong orgasms in rapid succession. She was caught in a crossfire of desperation and arousal. Her muscles were exhausted and ached with the strain of enduring 32 hour’s worth of boiling piss. Soon the battery of her undie ran out and the wild ride of orgasms came to an end. Jean was jolted back to her senses. The pain of her bladder hit her like Thor’s hammer.

Jean HAD TO PEE NOW! There was no more clenching of muscles, no willpower, no strength left in her. Her bladder was in charge now and without any warning it simply exploded. Jean’s floodgates finally burst open and a strong thick torrent of piss erupted from her pussy. All the thick sticky layer of cum on her thighs and the floor was washed away with the force of her piss. Jean was gasping for control but her bladder would not stand any more non-sense. She looked down, mortified, and saw a strong gush of piss still continuing to flood the room. Her fans were awestruck. Tips kept coming in like no tomorrow, as Tess adjusted the camera to focus on Jean’s crotch.

"I… I’m sorry" she groaned, realizing that she was losing the battle. The subscribers cheered her on, but Jean's world had collapsed to the little pee hold which was expelling hot steaming piss like a hose. She was beyond caring what was happening on the screen or what Tess would think. She was having a full-blown accident and there was nothing she could do about it. Only after half her piss was pushed out by her bladder, Jean clenched herself with a last burst of will power. The gusher came to a sudden halt with her hands seemingly welded to her crotch.

Tess and the entire audience of 72000, had the time of their lives. Jess not only managed to do a non-stop subathon for 30 hours but also managed to hold a drum of piss inside her all the time. Had it not been for the vibrating undies she may have made out dry as well. But it was too late to think about all that. She couldn’t believe her eyes to see what a huge sum of money she garnered. A whopping 111,000$.

As a last parting gift to her fans, she took out her top blew a kiss to the fans and closed the subathon. Once the she was logged out, Jean made a mad dash for the bathroom. Despite releasing such a massive flood a few minutes earlier, her pussy still quivered with jets of piss. She barely made it to the toilet and collapsed onto it with a sigh of relief. An even more powerful spray of piss hit the water below as she loudly moaned feeling a mix of hot arousal and desperation. The vibration of hot piss gushing out of her pussy tingled her and she was bombarded with one massive orgasm as if her body was thanking her!

Once she was empty, reality dawned on her - Jean was in a mix of feelings - humiliated and empowered at the same time. She couldn’t deny that it had been an exhilarating experience. The thrill of holding it in and the challenge of trying not to pee had been addictive. The series of orgasms was an added bonus and she couldn’t wait to try it again. But first, she needed to clean up the mess and take a long shower. She couldn’t bear the thought of sitting in her own urine any longer. As she got up, she felt another small trickle down her legs. She sighed and shook her head, realizing that she had a lot to learn about holding her bladder for long periods of time.

As Jean cleaned up the mess, she couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. She had just wet herself on a live stream, in front of thousands of people. But somehow, she felt liberated by the experience. When she finally emerged from the bathroom after all the cleanup and the shower, Tess was waiting for her with a bottle of water and a congratulatory hug.

“You did it! 30 hours of subathon with a 36 hour overfull bladder !” Tess exclaimed, grinning. Another spurt of pee escaped from Jean's pussy onto Tess's thighs as they embraced each other. Jean smiled weakly, still feeling a bit embarrassed about the leak. “THIS WAS HOT,” Tess said. Jean was still shuddering at the memory of the desperation and arousal she had felt. All Jean could do was nod in agreement as Tess laughed. “Hey, you made bank and got your surgery money. And who knows, maybe next time we can make it a 48-hour subathon and make double the money!”

Jean loved the idea. It got her thinking, “If a 30 hour marathon got me close to 90,000$, what would happen if I held it longer.” She immediately changed her online profile name to “BurstingJean” and from that day on, she made it her mission to master the art of bladder control. She started practicing holding it in for longer and longer periods of time, drinking more and wearing tighter, sexier clothes. It became her second nature to test her limits and push herself to maddening states of desperation. And although she had her fair share of accidents along the way, she never gave up. It was a new kind of thrill, one that she couldn’t get enough of. And she knew that as long as she kept pushing herself, there would always be another challenge to conquer.

My third story:

This is about Tifa and Aerith's grit to prove to each other that they are strong and can hold it more and longer than the other!

&&

Tifa and Aerith were fighting a terrifying monster, who created ruckus in the nearby village. As they approached the beast, Tifa realized that she had made a grave mistake. She had drunk too much water before the battle, and now her bladder was making its presence known. Aerith was engaged in her rigorous training, chugging glass after glass of water to beat the heat. She was also in a similar predicament, and grimaced while looking at Tifa.

"Can we take a quick bathroom break before we fight this thing?" Tifa asked, fidgeting uncomfortably.

"Are you kidding me, Tifa? We don't have time for that. The monster won't wait for us," Aerith said, crossing her legs. Tifa groaned, knowing that Aerith was right. They couldn't afford to waste time. Each second of delay meant more innocents losing their lives. She tried to focus on the task at hand and quickly came up with a strategy. They quickly landed powerful punches to the grotesque monster, but it hit them back. The girls tired their best to defend themselves especially their throbbing midsections. But as the battle grew more intense, things were slipping out of their hands and pee out of their bodies. Spurts of piss erupted as they ran, jumped, and kicked. Despite their years of practice and experience, they were unable to contain their bladders. It was a shame!

"Oh god, Aerith, I don't think I can hold it anymore," Tifa groaned as the monster thrashed her against the wall.

"Don't you dare pee a drop. We are in the middle of a fight! Tifa. I'm warning you," Aerith said, gritting her teeth.

"I'm not going to pee. Its – I’m just hurt, Aerith. But if you keep distracting me, I might accidentally let it out," Tifa retorted.

Their bickering was only making things worse. The monster seemed to sense their vulnerability and attacked them with renewed vigour. Tifa and Aerith were forced to dodge and weave, their bladders straining with every movement. The sadist monster noticed that wherever the duo jumped to, a trail of piss was left behind on the ground. It grinned cunningly and cast a spell called Omora and laughed at them in a demonic voice, “This spell of mine will teach you a good lesson as your bladders succumb to the immense pressure”. True to his words, within a few seconds, the girls cried in despair as their muscles gave out. They both grabbed their crotch in a last attempt to save their dignity, but alas, the flood was simply unstoppable. Piss gurgled out of their clasped palms and splattered everywhere. They were holding so much piss that their boots got filled up completely and even formed a huge puddle around.

"Aerith, you did this to me! You distracted me!" Tifa accused, pointing a finger at her friend.

"I did not! You were the one who had to drink a gallon of water before we left. YOU ARE WEAK" Aerith countered, screaming at the top of her lungs making it known to all the villagers.

The battle was lost. The monster had defeated them, not with brute strength, but with a spell that exploited their bodily functions. Tifa and Aerith lay on the ground, defeated, and embarrassed. The monster stopped attacking the village and left them humiliated.

"I can't believe I lost to a monster like this." Tifa said, tears of disgrace in her eyes.

"I know. We were so close to winning, but your bladder let us down. Seeing you piss yourself; I too couldn’t hold it back.” Aerith said, trying to console her friend.

As they made their way back to the village, Tifa and Aerith couldn't look the villagers in the eye even when they were rooting for them, for having the courage to pick up the fight with the monster.

"Well, at least we know now that we need to go to the bathroom before a battle," Aerith again said, chuckling. "It’s a lesson learned, Tifa and I strongly believe you need to be stronger!”

“Excuse me! What do you mean stronger?” You too pissed yourself out there Aerith, in spite of training so hard!” Tifa was furious. She had enough of the accusations. “I will prove to you that I am not who is weak. I will reach a point where I will hold it out and you will piss yourself embarrassingly”

The embarrassing defeat shook the foundation of their friendship. Tifa and Aerith were determined to come back stronger and more prepared for their next battle. But more importantly, it had become personal for Tifa, and she was willing to go to any lengths to defeat Aerith.

Fast Forward a few months - - -

Tifa shifted her weight from one foot to the other, trying to alleviate the pressure on her bladder. She tried to distract herself by counting the money in the cash register, but it wasn't working. Her milky white thighs rubbed against each other. Heels clicked on the floor. As much as Tifa tried to deny it – she couldn’t. She needed to relieve herself – badly. It wasn’t devastatingly urgent yet, but she had to clench herself constantly to push the pressure back. It has become almost a daily routine for her to hold her pee while serving the customers but today she had a bladder-buster challenge with a few of her customers. Needless to say, she won it hands down. Her bladder though was unhappy with the extra beer.

Aerith was there since afternoon, relaxing. From the corner of her eyes, she kept an eye on Tifa’s growing discomfort. Being an expert in reading body language, she immediately realized the reason behind her subtle squirming. It reminded of her own bladder pangs, but she chose to ignore it.

"Hey, Tifa, what's wrong?" Aerith approached Tifa, with a smirk on her face.

"Nothing, I'm fine," Tifa replied with a forced smile.

Aerith raised an eyebrow, noticing Tifa's crossed legs. "You're not fine, Tifa. You need the little girl’s room, don’t you? Too much beer, I suppose?" She teased.

Tifa glared at her, "Nothing I can’t manage. I just put off my bathroom breaks, all day."

Aerith chuckled and walked over to the door of the bathroom, "Well, I guess it's a good thing I got here just in time to lock the bathroom door." Tifa's eyes widened with horror. She never imagined Aerith to be a sadist.

"Aerith, don’t you dare!" Tifa protested, but it was too late. The bathroom door clicked shut, and Tifa was left standing there with disbelief. “Why would you do that?”

"Tifa – you call yourself so strong. Always try to impress Cloud. But I guess - you should be able to hold your pee also, then." Aerith giggled. "Look at me, even I haven't peed since morning. But I am fine. It’s just been what – 15 hours" Tifa wouldn't back down from a challenge. She looked at the small bulge in her bladder and tried to recall whatever she chugged throughout the day. It was not much by her standards – 5 pints of beer, two litres of water and a few juices to battle the heat of the day. She shrugged to herself before hitting back Aerith with determination.

"You haven't gone to the bathroom since morning too? Challenge accepted!" Tifa declared, with a competitive gleam in her eye. “I will show her what’s it means to be strong!”

Aerith grinned mischievously, "Oh, it's on."

“So, let’s set up some ground rules – we drink the same amount of liquid – And we will come up with challenge to break each other’s bladder in turns. Deal?” Tifa stated bluntly. Aerith nodded as if she had already won.

“Good! Now since you’re so enthusiastic – let me invite you to drink my creation called “the Bahr” – It literally means ‘The Sea’ in Arabic and it is one of the strongest diuretics on the planet.”

Aerith gulped in anticipation. “Tifa’s probably trying to screw with my mind. What could the drink possibly do which my bladder cannot handle!”

But the game had just began. Tifa filled two giant sized jugs with beer and added vials of a shimmery liquid in each. “This should do the trick” Tifa nonchalantly mentioned to Aerith.

“What can a jug of beer possibly do to my bottomless bladder!” Aerith laughed.

“We will see” Tifa shrugged and put the jug to her lips, chugging down the beer.

After a couple of minutes, they both slammed the jugs on the table. It was enough time for the Bahr to kick in. The girls immediately crossed their legs tightly.

“What the hell is this!” Aerith exclaimed as she felt the pressure inside reach new heights. Her fists were clenched tight as her kidneys ferociously pumped pee into her bladder, more than what she anticipated. Tifa was no better, but she was used to drinking Bahr on days when she felt adventurous. And today was one such day when Aerith pulled the wrong string.

It took quite some time for Aerith to get accustomed to the increased pressure. Her playful demeanour was replaced by a worried one. She brought her legs together, squeezing them tight. She clenched her jaws to fight back the sudden increase in pressure. Tifa couldn't help but chuckle as she watched Aerith's face contort in discomfort. The Bahr was starting to take effect, and it was clear that Aerith was struggling to hold back the sudden wave of desperation hitting the walls of her bladder. Tifa had a mischievous gleam in her eyes as she teased her friend, "Looks like someone's in trouble! Can't handle the Bahr?"

Aerith shot Tifa a withering look, but the strain on her face betrayed the truth. "You didn't tell me it was going to be this intense," she gasped, trying to hold back the flow of pee that was threatening to escape.

Tifa shrugged nonchalantly. "What can I say? You wanted to play the game, and I wanted to spice things up a bit. And it looks like I succeeded!"

Aerith shot Tifa a death glare. "Oh shut up, Tifa. I'm doing just fine," she lied through gritted teeth. In reality, she was exasperated that just a little vial of Bahr wreaked havoc with her iron bladder. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, trying to find a more comfortable position.

Tifa chuckled. "Sure, you are, Aerith. You're practically bouncing up and down like a little kid who needs to pee."

"I do not!" Aerith protested, her face turning red with embarrassment.

Tifa grinned. "Don't worry, Aerith. I won't judge you for having a weak bladder. Some people just aren't cut out for holding it like me."

Aerith scowled. "I am not weak, Tifa. I can hold my pee just as well as you can. In fact, I want to make it more difficult. How about doing the dishes? “

Tifa raised an eyebrow, "Doing the dishes? How does that make it more difficult?"

Aerith stood up and walked towards the sink, trying to look calm. "Simple. We'll do the dishes together. That way, we have to lean over and twist our bodies to reach everything, putting more pressure on our bladders. And to make it more interesting, we have to keep our legs apart all the time!"

Tifa chuckled. "Alright, you're on. Let's see who can come out dry."

As soon as they dipped their hands in water, their bladders spasmed, as if they were shouting at the girls for being so dumb. Tifa, shivered with the rising pressure inside her. Every time she leaned over the sink, she could feel her bladder pushing for release. But she didn't want to let Aerith see her weakness. She tried to act calm and collected, but her face betrayed her true feelings. The splashes of cold water in her midriff and her naked thighs only added to her woes.

Aerith was struggling too, but she was hell bent to keep herself corked up. She gritted her teeth and tried to ignore the growing pain in her lower abdomen. She constantly shifted her weight from one foot to the other, trying to relieve the pressure. The effect of Bahr was still strong on her. She hated the fact that every time she had to reach out to the faucet, she had to bend over squeezing her bladder against the platform.

Tifa couldn't help but tease Aerith a little, hoping to get on her nerves. "You know, if you need to pee, you can just give up. I won't tell anyone."

Aerith shot her a dirty look. "I'm not giving up, Tifa. I can hold it just as long as you can." She was annoyed that the game which she started seemed to slip away from her hands.

Tifa grinned. "We'll see about that."

They continued doing the dishes, each one trying to outdo the other without losing their balance or breaking any dishes. The pressure inside their bladders was becoming more pronounced, but neither one wanted to give up. They were determined to prove their strength. Around two long hours of struggle, they finished up, Tifa could barely stand upright. Aerith was in a similar state, her face twisted in pain.

They both looked at each other, waiting to see who would give in first. But to their surprise, neither one did. They had both managed to hold their pee despite the strong pressure.

Tifa grinned. "Looks like we have a tie, Aerith. I guess we'll have to do something else to break the deadlock." Aerith feared what was coming next, but it was the part of the deal. The holding competition would continue till one of them loses. “What do you suggest Tifa?”

"Let's take it one notch higher. I am sure you can't beat this one. We'll play carrom. Every time we miss a shot we drink a glass of water." Tifa announced with a strain in her voice.

Aerith's eyes widened. "Are you serious, Tifa?"

"Am I flinching? " Tifa said sternly. "And I hope you will not back off, cause I am in the mood to push myself to my absolute limits.”

Aerith was panicking inside, her heart racing. After 18 hours of holding and so many tortures already imposed on her bladder her determination seemed to waver. It was indeed a challenge which could burst her floodgates open. She gulped in nervousness. It was true that she loved a good challenge, but she also knew her limits. Could she really handle drinking that much water and holding her pee for even longer? But then her competitive spirit kicked in, and she nodded firmly. "Alright, Tifa. Let's do this. I'm ready for your challenge."

Tifa grinned mischievously as Aerith nodded in agreement. She could tell that her friend was nervous, and that made her even more determined to win this round. The game started off slow, both of them taking their time with each shot, trying to outdo each other without making any mistakes. However, with a bladder sloshing around with so much piss inside, it was difficult to concentrate. As the game tension started to build. Shot after shot, they missed the hole. One glass turned to two, two to four and so on. Their stomach bulged with so much water inside. The weight of the water was pushing their bladder down and the kidneys worked in turbo mode to pump it into their severely strained bladders. The small of their back was hurting with the intensity.

Aerith saw Tifa taking too long to strike. She was feeling a sense of satisfaction as she watched her friend squirm. "Having trouble, Tifa?" she teased, as she lined up her next shot. "Maybe you should have thought twice before about this challenge."

Tifa clenched her jaws in frustration, trying her best to stay focused on the game. She knew that Aerith was just trying to get into her head, but it was working. Her bladder was screaming for relief, and she could feel the pee inching closer to her hole. As they played on, the stakes kept getting higher. They had already downed 14 glasses of water each, and their bladders were now at their absolute limits. But neither of them wanted to give up. They were both determined to win, no matter the cost.

Aerith let out a small whimper as she missed another shot, and Tifa grinned triumphantly. "Looks like you're going to have to drink another glass, Aerith," she said, trying to hide her own discomfort. Aerith glared at her friend, but there was a hint of admiration in her eyes. "You're really good at this, Tifa," she said, as she reached for another glass of water. "But I promise I will not make it easy for you."

And so, the game continued, each shot becoming more and more difficult as they struggled to hold onto their dignity and their full bladders. They were both sweating now, the room feeling like a sauna as they battled it out on the carrom board. Each gulp of water was like a boxer’s blow to their bladders.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Tifa missed a shot. It was just a small mistake, but it was enough to give Aerith the opening she needed. She quickly sank her last few pieces, grinning triumphantly as Tifa let out a groan of defeat.

"Looks like I win this round," Aerith said, trying to hide the relief in her voice.

Tifa just smiled wearily. "Good job, Aerith," she said. "But too bad for you, my bladder has not given up yet. It’s your turn now to suggest the next challenge.” As they packed up the carrom board, they felt proud of their self-control. They were pushing themselves to the absolute limits, and each fiercely wanted to come out on top.

Aerith knew that she still had a chance to win if she could throw a really tough un-maginable challenge in Tifa’s way.

Aerith chuckled, "You really are something, Tifa. I never thought you would be able to hang for this long. Though it’s still very easy for me"

Tifa mocked Aerith, feeling a sense of pride. "It's all about determination and self-control, Aerith. And I think you need to learn that better".

Aerith hit back "Oh really? You're just lucky this time, Tifa. And if you want to prove me wrong, you better beat me at this." Tifa knew that she was treading dangerous waters now, given that her own bladder was at the verge of exploding. But she went on trying to act brave. “Go ahead, spit it out!”

Aerith grinned mischievously as she laid down the challenge to Tifa. "I bet you to hold your pee overnight," she said, her eyes gleaming with excitement. "Let's apply tapes on our underwear so that we can't cheat and see who gives up first in the morning!"

Tifa hesitated for a moment, knowing full well the torture her bladder had endured throughout the day. But she couldn't back down now. "You're on," she said, trying to sound confident. Both the girls applied the tape on their underwear, making sure there was no way they could cheat. The feeling of pressure on their bladders was already overwhelming, and they were absolutely frantic for a pee. They said their goodbyes, each heading home to face the ultimate test of bladder endurance.

Tifa walked home with a sense of dread. With every step she felt her bladder slosh with piss. A strong ache plagued her bladder and lower back. It was like a ticking time bomb, and she knew it could explode at any moment. Once at home, all the pretence of maintaining composure was out of the window. She thought of quickly unbuttoning her tight miniskirt, the waistband of which cut into her bladder. But then her eyes fell on the tape. There was no way she could cheat.

She kept murmuring to herself under the breath to encourage herself. Anything that could take her mind off the maddening pressure was tried by her. Be it music or TV or sketching. But nothing worked. It was simply impossible to focus on anything with a blob of piss trying to make its way out of her body. and watching TV, but every minute felt like an eternity. She couldn't focus on anything other than the intense need to pee. But as the night wore on, the pressure on Tifa's bladder became unbearable. She shifted uncomfortably on her couch, trying to find a position that would alleviate some of the pressure, but it was futile. Tifa had been holding for over 22 hours now, and her bladder felt like it was going to burst. "Why did I agree to this fucked up challenge?" she muttered to herself, nearly pulling her hair off. But then she remembered the battle of Omora and started with a new vigour.

Meanwhile, at her own apartment, Aerith was battling with the very same thing. Every time she got up to walk around or do something, her bladder screamed for a release. Her eyes fell on the door of the bathroom. The mere thought of being so close to the toilet sent her into a frenzy. A sudden wave of piss hit her hard, and she collapsed on the floor. Her hand flew to her crotch, clawing her nails into her underwear. Her face was red as tomato with the strain of holding back the flood. increased. She was determined not to lose this challenge, but her bladder was pushing her to the limit.

"Come on, Aerith, you can do this," she whispered to herself, trying to psych herself up.

But as the hours ticked by, the pressure became more and more intense. Aerith couldn't concentrate on anything else, and she was starting to lose her mind. She couldn’t fathom how can the pressure keep on rising. At some point in time, it was supposed to plateau but no! It kept growing by the minute.

The clock struck 7am, 28 hours separating them from their last piss.

Tifa's alarm rang. It was time for her to check in on the challenge. She video-called Aerith on phone. Her heart sank when Aerith showed her underwear still dry and the tape intact. Tifa did the same. The competition was a tie yet again as they both were holding on strong.

Following the call, they decided to gather at the bar again. The tension between them was palpable as they both tried to hide their discomfort. They were both exhausted, having spent the entire night battling against their bladders. They could put even the mightiest bladder on the planet to shame. The football sized bulge on their bladder was a testimony to 30 torturous hours of holding. Their kidneys worked in overtime and pushed in nearly 5 liters of piss in their bladders.

"I hope you're ready to lose," Aerith said, trying to sound confident. The shaky voice gave her away though.

Tifa tried to smirk in response. "Don't count me out yet," she said, hoping her voice didn't betray her desperation.

As they took their seats at the bar, they looked at the obscene bulge on each other’s bladder. They tried to act as if they felt nothing. Reality was far from it. Their eyes were afloat with hot boiling piss, which was begging for relief for the last 31 hours now. Every passing minute, their agony increased by leaps and bounds. To their utter dismay, both of them were still dry. Except the wetness of sweat, underwear of both the girls were free from any piss stains. The competition was tied again. Neither of them wanted to give up, and neither of them wanted to be the first to break. They both shifted in their seats, trying to find a way to relieve some of the pressure without giving in. Just then Tifa groaned as a particularly strong wave hit her bladder walls.

"Tifa – it seems you are b-bursting! I won’t judge you if you need to go," Aerith tried to mock Tifa but it sounded more like a plead so that she herself could go once Tifa accepts defeat. But the game was far from over. Tifa shook her head in disagreement even though she was sweating profusely. Instead of giving up she came up with yet another challenge which would prove to be the ultimate one. Her heart was racing as she spoke, “I will not pee – I can h-hold it still. In fact, I can defeat you in Twister even in such a condition”.

Aerith raised her eyebrow in surprise, "Twister? Are you serious, Tifa? You can barely sit still, let alone play Twister!" she said, trying to mask her own discomfort.

Tifa just shrugged, "I'm pretty confident my bladder can still take anything, unlike yours. “she said, hoping the game would take her mind off her painfully full bladder. Aerith hesitated for a moment, but then nodded. "Alright, let's do it. But be warned, I'm not holding back," she said, determination in her voice.

As they began the game, it became clear that both of them were struggling to not only maintain their balance but also their dryness. Every few seconds, they would check the wetness of their underwear. Deep down, they knew that their bladders could burst any moment. Their movements were slow and cautious, each one trying to outdo the other without losing their footing.

"Right foot, green!" Tifa announced, trying to focus on the game and not the discomfort between her legs. Aerith contorted her body, trying to reach the green circle without falling. "Left hand, yellow!" she countered, gritting her teeth as her bladder protested the sudden movement. Tifa winced as she stretched to reach the yellow circle, her bladder now screaming for release. "I'm not sure I can do this much longer," Tifa muttered under her breath.

Aerith grinned, "I hope you're ready to lose," she said, trying to sound confident. Tifa just smirked in response. "Don't count me out yet," she said, hoping her voice didn't betray her desperation. As the game continued, both of them were getting more and more desperate. Every move was a struggle, every twist and turn a new test of endurance. But neither of them would give up, not when victory was so close. Rivulets of sweat flowed from their bodies drenching the mat below. It was not long before the mat turned so slippery that they started to lose balance.

An hour passed since the game started. The way their bodies were entangled, it was simply impossible to exercise any control on their nether muscles. The only thing that stood between them and their relief was sheer will power and yes, breath control. Their faces had turned blue with the effort of holding their breath. Somehow it seemed the only way to keep the floodgates from opening. Anyone who placed their hand on the bulge of the bladder could have felt the heat of the piss inside. They were catastrophically desperate now.

Suddenly, Aerith lost her balance. For a moment she was airborne and the next moment, she fell flat on her rock-hard bladder. THAT-WAS-IT. She curled on the sweaty mat shoving her hands in the crotch, holding on for her dear life. The force of the piss pounded her overworked muscles like a rolling boulder. She cried in pain trying to keep the lake of pee inside, but it was impossible. Her muscles were on fire it seemed. An inch thick stream of piss erupted from her pussy. The torrent was so strong that Tifa was about to fall down.

The gusher spread afar, soaking the wooden floor below. A strong smell of piss filled the room as her steaming piss spread around in whatever gap and crevices came its way. Aerith’s face was scrunched up and fingers digging deep into her skin trying to somehow bring it to halt but in vain. She gasped, grabbed, and writhed herself to prevent any more damage but her body just didn’t comply with her. It was worse than the Omora spell. Pee worth gallons stored inside for over 33 hours finally escaped her iron control.

Tifa looked at Aerith sympathetically but couldn't help feeling a sense of victory. She had won the ultimate bladder endurance challenge ever and was still containing her waters without a drop of leakage.

"Thanks, Aerith – now you know who is strong enough!" Tifa said, still trying to hide her own discomfort. "But you were a good competitor and I respect that.” Aerith nodded embarrassed.

“Let's get you cleaned up first, and then we can celebrate my victory with a few MORE glasses of water."

"You aren't going to pee yet?" Aerith asked dumbfounded.

"Nope! I love the feeling of being in control. I will continue to keep myself corked up! Tifa said proudly. Aerith just shook her head in disbelief, "I don't know how you do it, Tifa. I'm just glad this torture is over," she said, making her way to the restroom to clean up. As Tifa watched her friend go, Tifa’s legs wobbled. Her pussy was on fire and her insides felt as if it was chained to an ever-expanding ball of water. She couldn't help but feel a sense of pride after proving that she had what it took to hold her pee for as long as she wanted. Tifa won finally and the feeling was just so addictive!
